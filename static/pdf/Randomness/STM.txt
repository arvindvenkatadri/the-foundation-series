# Introduction
This is a Research Application Note blah blah blah...fill this in

First I will load up the required R packages

```{r Library Set up, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
```


Then I get my Sampling Survey data in.

```{r Get Data in}
doe <- read_excel("~/Documents/STM Testing - Working.xlsx")
str(doe)
head(doe)
tail(doe)
#View(doe) 
```


# Steps that I need to follow to analyze my Survey :
1. Take means of WORD and DIGIT scores
2. Variances of WORD and DIGIT scores
2. Take means of WORD and DIGIT scores, "Segregated" by Gender
3. Plot histograms of WORD and DIGIT Scores
4. Plot historgrams of WORD and DIGIT segregated by Gender
5. Maybe something else too, God knows!


## Step 1: Check the Overall Means and Variances

```{r Overall Means and Variance all scores}
doe %>% 
  select(`Word Score`,`Digit Score`) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(length,mean,var))

#Same command again with Tabulation
doe %>% 
  select(`Word Score`,`Digit Score`) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(length,mean,var)) %>% 
  kable() # Creates a neat table
```

### What do we learn from the overall Means and Variances?

## Step 2: Take means of WORD and DIGIT scores, "Segregated" by Gender

```{r Segregated Counts, Means and Variances}

doe %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarise_all(funs(length,mean,var))

#Same command again, with tabulation
doe %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarise_all(funs(length,mean,var)) %>% 
  kable() # Creates a neat table
```
### What do we learn from the Segregated Means and Variances?

## Step 3: Simple Score Plots

```{r Some Simple Base R plots}
hist(doe$`Word Score`)
# Complete for Digit Score.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
```

OK, somewhat adventurous here and using the Tidyverse R package by *Hadley Wickham*, which implements *Leland Wilkinson*'s **Grammar of Graphics**

```{r Simple Plots using Tidyverse}
############################################################
# Histograms (using tidyverse, based on Leland Wilkinson's "Grammar of Graphics")
# Implemented in Hadley Wickham's super R-package "tidyverse")
# 
ggplot(doe) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = `Word Score`))
# Complete Histogram for Digit Score.







```



## Step 4: Plots of Word and Digit Scores factored by Gender

```{r Plots by Gender}
# Histograms using Base R, with some more bells and whistles.
# 
plot(doe$`Word Score`[doe$Gender=="Male"],
     main = "Scatter Plot for Male Word Recall Scores",
     xlab = "Index",
     ylab = "Word Recall Scores")

hist(doe$`Word Score`[doe$Gender=="Male"], 
     main = "Word Scores for Males", # Main Title
     xlab = "Score", # X Axis label
     ylab = "Frequency Count of Dudes", # Y Axis label
     col = "light blue",
     breaks = 20,
     xlim = c(1,10),
     ylim = c(0,20)) # colour of the bars

# Complete this chunk for Male/Female and for both  Word Score/Digit Score





```

```{r Box Whisker Plots}
# This is a Box Whisker plot that I will explain in class.
plot(x = factor(doe$Gender), y = doe$`Word Score`)
# Complete this Code Command for Digit Score











```



Now let us be *even more adventurous* and plot Gender-split data using the Tidyverse. This time we will dress up the plots in our favourite colours and fonts.

```{r Plots by Gender using Tidyverse}
# Histograms by Gender using Tidyverse for the more adventurous people!

ggplot(doe) + # Invokes the Tidyverse Plotting function
  geom_histogram(aes(x = `Word Score`)) + # Plots the Histogram
  facet_grid(~Gender,scales = "fixed") + # Splits the plots by Gender. 
  
  
# All the following stuff dresses up your plotNote the "+" sign: this R-Command Continues below ! 
# Examine the final plot and you can figure out which part of the command does what exactly to the plot below. 
  
    
  labs(title=" Are Girls better than Boys at Word recall?", # Creates Plot Title
       subtitle = "Word Recall Scores by Gender",           # Creates Plot subtitle
       caption = "Based on Survey in Srishti N3 campus") +  # Creates Plot caption
                                                            # Play with these
  
  
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),               
        
        plot.title = element_text(family = "American Typewriter",
                             face = "bold",
                             colour = "firebrick",
                             size = 16),
        
        panel.background = element_rect(fill ="light green"),
        
        strip.background = element_rect(fill ="light yellow"),
        
        strip.text = element_text(family = "Impact",
                                  size = 12,
                                  colour = "purple"))

######
 ggplot(doe) +
   geom_boxplot(aes(y = `Word Score`,colour = Gender)) # Dress up your plot here too!





# Repeat for Digit Score











 

```


# Commentary on Plots
Write your interpretations here. 













# Note on the t-Tests
We will compare the mean scores of Words and Digits grouped by Gender using a t-test. For a t-test to be successfully applied, the variances of the two sets of data being checked should be fairly equal. What this means is:

$$
Variance(Word Score for Males) \simeq Variance(Word Score for Females)\\
Variance(Digit Score for Males) \simeq Variance(Digit Score for Females)
$$

Comment on whether this is true of our data. Look at the results of the Segregated Means and Variances above. 













```{r Gender Diff in Digit Recall?}
#setting up "segregated" Digit Scores for Male and Female
#
figm <- doe %>% filter(Gender == "Male") %>% select(`Digit Score`) 
figf  <- doe %>% filter(Gender =="Female") %>% select(`Digit Score`)

# Run the t-test to compare the Means of these segregated scores
t.test(x = figm$`Digit Score`,
       y = figf$`Digit Score`,
       paired = FALSE)             
```

```{r Gender Diff in Word Recall?}



# Repeat this t.test for Word Scores also
```
```
### Finally, the Conclusions
Look at the result of the t.tests. The Confidence Interval shows the range over which the Score Difference ( Females vs Males) can vary. If that range includes ZERO, then what can we conclude?

And you are done. Whew!
