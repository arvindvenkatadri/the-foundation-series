# Introduction

We will create Distributions for data in R. As always, we will
consistently use the [**Project Mosaic**](https://mosaic-web.org)
ecosystem of packages in R (`mosaic`, `mosaicData` and `ggformula`).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = T, comment = "#>", echo = TRUE)
options(tibble.print_min = 4L, tibble.print_max = 4L)
library(mosaic) # package for stats, simulations, and basic plots
library(mosaicData) # package containing datasets
library(ggformula) # package for professional looking plots, that use the formula interface from mosaic
library(NHANES) # survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)

```

::: {#note .illustration style="background: beige"}
Note the standard method for all commands from the `mosaic` package:

goal( y \~ x \| z, data = mydata, ...)
:::


## Case Study -1: Dataset from `mosaicData`

Let us inspect what datasets are available in the package `mosaicData`.
Type `data(package = "mosaicData")` in your Console to see what datasets
are available.

Let us choose the famous `Galton` dataset:

```{r}
data("Galton")
inspect(Galton)

```

The data is described as:

> A data frame with 898 observations on the following variables. 
- `family` a factor with levels for each family 
- `father` the father's height (in inches) 
- `mother` the mother's height (in inches) 
- `sex` the child's sex: F or M 
- `height` the child's height as an adult (in inches) 
- `nkids` the number of adult children in the family, or, at least, the number whose heights Galton recorded.

There is a lot of Description generated by the `mosaic::inspect()` command ! 
What can we say about the dataset and its variables? How big is the dataset? How many variables? What types are they, Quant or Qual? If they are Qual, what are the *levels*? Are they *ordered* levels? Discuss!


### Stat Summaries

As Stigler said, **summaries** are the first thing to look at in data.
Let us tabulate some quick stat summaries of the important variables in
`Galton`:

```{r}
favstats(~ father, data = Galton)
favstats(~ height | sex, data = Galton)

```

Q.1 How many families in the data for each value of `nkids`? 

```{r}
tally(~ nkids, data = Galton)
```


Q.2. What is the break-up by `sex` of the child?

```{r}
tally(~ nkids | sex, data = Galton)
```


### Distribution Plots

What Questions might we have, that we could answer with a Distribution?

Q.1 How many families based on the number of children?

```{r}

# Convert the tally into a dataframe. See the difference!
family_count <- tally( ~ nkids | sex, data = Galton) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  
  # Convert nkids from char to int
  mutate( nkids = as.integer(nkids))
family_count
gf_col(n ~ nkids | sex, data = family_count, fill = ~ sex, ylab = "Number of Families", xlab = "Number of Kids / Family")
```


Q.2: How are the children's heights distributed?

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ height, data = Galton) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = mean(Galton$height))

```


Q.3: Is there a difference in height distributions between Male and Female children?

```{r}
measures <- favstats(~ height | sex, data = Galton)
measures

gf_histogram(~ height | sex, data = Galton) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = ~ mean, data = measures)

```


Q.4: Are Mothers generally shorter than fathers?
```{r}
gf_density(~ father, data = Galton, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3) %>% 
  gf_density( ~ mother, data = Galton, fill = "red", alpha = 0.3, xlab = "Heights")
  
```


Q.5: Are heights of children different based on the number of kids in the family? For Male and Female children?

```{r}
gf_boxplot(height ~ sex | nkids, data = Galton)

```


Q.6: Does the **mean** height of children in a family vary with the number of children in the family? ( family size) 

```{r}
mean( height ~ sex | nkids, data = Galton) %>% as_tibble() # not very inspiring!
by_sex_nkids <- favstats( height ~ sex + nkids, data = Galton)
by_sex_nkids # much better!

```

```{r}
gf_col(mean ~ sex.nkids, data = by_sex_nkids)
```

Hmm...not a *very* informative plot...

## Case Study-2: Dataset from `NHANES`

Let us try the `NHANES` dataset. Try `help(NHANES)` in your Console. 

```{r}
data("NHANES")
names(NHANES)
```

### Stat Summaries
```{r}
mosaic::inspect(NHANES)
```

Again, lots of data from `inspect`, about the Quant and Qual variables. Spend a little time looking through the output of `inspect`. 
Which variables could have been data *given* by each respondent, and which ones could have been *measured* data variables? Why do you think so?  
Why is there so much *missing* data?  Which variable are the most affected by this?



```{r}
tally(Education ~ Work, data = NHANES)

```

### Distribution Plots
Q.1. What is the distribution of Physical Activity Days, across Gender? Across Education?
```{r}
gf_histogram(data = NHANES, ~ PhysActiveDays | Gender)
gf_histogram(data = NHANES, ~ PhysActiveDays | Education)

```

Q.1. How are people Ages distributed across levels of Education?
```{r}
gf_boxplot(Age ~ Education, data = NHANES)
```
Q.2. How is Education distributed over Race?
```{r}
gf_histogram()
```

Q.3 What is the distribution of people's BMI, split by Gender? By Race1?
```{r}
gf_histogram(~ BMI | Gender, data = NHANES)
gf_histogram(~ BMI | Race1 + Race3, data = NHANES)

```








## Case Study-3: A complete example

Here is a dataset from Jeremy Singer-Vine's blog, [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/). This is a list of all books banned in schools across the US. 

```{r, bar-charts}
banned <- readxl::read_xlsx(path = "data/banned.xlsx",
                            sheet = "Sorted by Author & Title")
banned

names(banned)
``` 
Clearly the variables are *all* Qualitative, except perhaps for *Date of Challenge/Removal, (which in this case has been badly mangled by Excel)
So we need to make **counts** based on the *levels* of the Qual variables and plot Bar/Column charts. 

Let us quickly make some Stat Summaries:

```{r}
mosaic::inspect(banned)
```

Let us try to answer this question: *What is the count of banned books by type and by US state?*

```{r}
banned_by_state <- banned %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(total = n()) %>% ungroup()
banned_by_state

banned %>% group_by(State, `Type of Ban`) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% left_join(., banned_by_state, by = c("State" = "State")) %>% 
 #  pivot_wider(.,id_cols = State,
 #              names_from = `Type of Ban`,
 #              values_from = count) %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% 
 #  replace_na(list(banned_from_libraries_and_classrooms = 0,
 #                  banned_from_libraries = 0,
 #                  banned_pending_investigation = 0,
 #                  banned_from_classrooms = 0)) %>% 
 # mutate(total = sum(across(where(is.integer)))) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(State, total), y = count, fill = `Type of Ban`)) + geom_col() + coord_flip()

```
