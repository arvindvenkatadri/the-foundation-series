## Case Study-1: Verizon

Does Verizon create a difference in Repair Times between ILEC and CLEC
systems?

```{r}

data("Verizon")
inspect(Verizon)

```

Describe the Variables!

```{r observed-statistic-verizon}



```

### Hypothesis Specification

Write the Null and Alternate hypotheses here.


### Null Distribution Computation

```{r null-distribution-by-permutation}



```

### Verizon Conclusion




## Case Story-2: Recidivism

Do criminals released after a jail term commit crimes again? Does
recidivism depend upon age?

```{r}

data("Recidivism")
inspect(Recidivism)

```

Describe the variables!

### Hypothesis Specification

Let us see if the indidence of recidivism is dependent upon whether a
person is aged less than or more than 25 years. Write the Null and
Alternate hypotheses here.

\$\$ H_0: \mu\_{recid_25_minus}

\$\$

```{r observed-statistic-recid}
Recidivism


```

Also, the variable <tt>`Recid`</tt> is a factor variable coded "Yes" or
"No". We ought to convert it to a numeric variable of 1's and 0's.
Why?

```{r}



```


### Null Distribution for Recidivism

```{r}


```

### Recidivism Conclusion



### Case Study #3: Flight Delays

LaGuardia Airport (LGA) is one of three major airports that serves the
New York City metropolitan area. In 2008, over 23 million passengers and
over 375 000 planes flew in or out of LGA. United Airlines and America
Airlines are two major airlines that schedule services at LGA. The data
set `FlightDelays` contains information on all 4029 departures of these
two airlines from LGA during May and June 2009.

```{r}
data("FlightDelays")
inspect(FlightDelays)

```

The variables in the `FlightDelays` dataset are:



### Hypothesis Specification

Let us compute the proportion of times that each carrier's flights was delayed more than 20 min. We will conduct a two-sided test to see if the difference in these proportions is statistically significant.

```{r flightDelays-observed-difference}



```

### Null Distribution for `FlightDelays`

```{r}


```



```{r p-value-into-2}


```

which is very small. Hence we reject the null Hypothesis that there is
no difference between `carrier`s on `delay times`.
