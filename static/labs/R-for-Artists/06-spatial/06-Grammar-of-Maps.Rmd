# Introduction

This RMarkdown document is part of the Generic Skills Component  (GSK) of the Course of the  Foundation Studies Programme at Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, Bangalore India. The material is based on *A Layered Grammar of Graphics* by Hadley Wickham. The course is meant for First Year students pursuing a Degree in Art and Design. 

The intent of this GSK part is to build Skill in coding in R, and also appreciate R as a way to metaphorically visualize information of various kinds, using predominantly geometric figures and structures.

All RMarkdown files combine code, text, web-images, and figures developed using code. Everything is text; code chunks are enclosed in **fences** (```)


# Goals

At the end of this Lab session, we should:  
- know the types and structures of `spatial data` and be able to work with them  
- understand the basics of modern spatial packages in R  
- be able to specify and download spatial data from the web, using R from sources such as `naturalearth` and `Open Streep Map`  
- plot *static* and *interactive* maps using `ggplot`, `tmap` and `leaflet` packages  
- add symbols and markers for places and regions of our own interest in these maps.  
- plot maps on a globe using the `threejs` package  




# Pedagogical Note

The method followed will be based on
[PRIMM](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/cser/2017/09/01/primm-a-structured-approach-to-teaching-programming/):

-   **PREDICT** Inspect the code and guess at what the code might do,
    **write predictions**
-   **RUN** the code provided and check what happens
-   **INFER** what the `parameters` of the code do and **write comments to explain**. What bells and whistles can you see?
-   **MODIFY** the `parameters` code provided to understand the
    `options` available. **Write comments** to show what you have aimed for and achieved.
-   **MAKE** : take an idea/concept of your own, and graph it.

All jargon words will be capitalized and in **bold** font. 


## Set Up

The `setup` code **chunk** below brings into our coding session **R packages** that provide specific computational abilities and also **datasets** which we can use. 

To reiterate: Packages and datasets are **not** the same thing !! Packages are (small) collections of programs. Datasets are just....information.

# Introduction to Maps in R

We will take small steps in making maps using just two of the several map making packages in R.

The steps we will use are:

1. Search for an area of interest
2. Learn how to access spatial/map data using `osmdata`
3. Plot and dress up our map using `ggplot` and `tmap`
4. Create interactive maps with `leaflet` using a variety of map data providers. Note: `tmap` can also do interactive maps which we will explore also. 

Bas. Onwards and Map-wards!!


# Step1 - Specifying an area of interest

In R, we need to specify a "**BOUNDING BOX**" first, to declare our area of interest. God made me a BengaluR-kaR...I think..Let's see if we can declare an area of interest. Then we can order on Swiggy and...never mind. 

We can declare a **BOUNDING BOX** in several ways, using a variety of R packages.

a) Using a rough longitude latitude info directly, or using a place name to search for the long/lat info. THIS WILL ALWAYS WORK if the LON/LAT NUMBERS ARE OK !!

```{r I-am-going-home 1}
# BLR Bounding Box using `osmplotr` package
# get_bbox is a command from the `osmplotr` package
# get_bbox needs lat and lon ranges
# Format is c(min-lon, min-lat, max-lon, max-lat)
bbox_1 <- osmplotr::get_bbox(latlon = c(77.46,12.83,77.74,13.14))
bbox_1

```


b) Using a place name to look up a BOUNDING BOX. This may not always work if the place name is know well known.

```{r I-am-going-home 2}
# Using getbb command from the osmdata package
bbox_2 <- osmdata::getbb("Jayanagar, Bangalore, India")
bbox_2

```

Let us examine all the calculated BOUNDING BOXes

```{r}
bbox_1
bbox_2

```
`bbox_1` is quite big: 0.3 degrees range in both lon and lat. 
`bbox_2` is reasonably sized: 0.04 degrees in longitude range and in latitude range.

We will use the  `bbox_2` from the above, to ensure we have smaller data downloads! 

# Step2 - Get Map data

Within our `bbox` for Jayanagar, Bangalore, we want to download diverse kinds of **FEATURE** data. Remember that a **FEATURE** is any object that can be "seen" on a map. This is done using the `osmplotr::extract_osm_objects()` command. The main parameters for this command are:

- bbox  
- **KEY / VALUE** pairs (**"TAGS"**) to specify the kind of feature you need  
- **return_type** if you want a specific kind of geometry to be returned. Say you want only **POINT** locations of restaurants, and not their buildings themselves. Then you need to say `return_type = "point"`.

## Using Open Street Map (OSM)
> [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) provides maps of the world mostly created by volunteers. They are completely free to browse and use, with attribution to © OpenStreetMap contributors and adherence to the ODbL license required, and are used by many public and private organisations. 
OSM data can be downloaded in vector format and used for our own purposes. In this tutorial, we will obtain data from OSM using a `query`. A query is a request for data from a database. Simple queries can be performed more easily using the `osmdata` library for R, which automatically constructs the query and imports the data in a convenient format. 

## OSM feature key-value pairs
Open Street Map **features** have attributes in **key-value pairs**. We can use them to download the specific data we need. These features can easily be explored in the web browser, by using the ‘Query features’ button on [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/):

![](images/osm-online-features.gif)  

Head off to [OSM Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to try this out and to get an intuitive understanding of what OSM **key-value pairs** are, for different types of map **features**. Look for places of interest to you (**features**) and see what **key-value** pairs attach to those features.

NOTE: **key-value pairs** are also referred to as **tags**. 

Useful **key-value pairs** / **tags** include:

KEY | VALUEs
----|-------
building | yes (all), house residential, apartments
highway | residential, service, track, unclassified, footway, path
amenity | parking, parking_space, bench; place_of_worship;  restaurant, cafe, fast_food; school, waste_basket, fuel, bank, toilets...
shop | convenience, supermarket, clothes, hairdresser, car-repair...
name | actual name of the place e.g. Main_Street, *McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Subway*
waterway |
natural |
boundary |

For more information see: 

See [OSM Tags](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) for a nice visual description of popular **key-value pairs** that we can use.  

See what the `highway` tag looks like
[tag : highway](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/highway#values)

## Downloading Data from Open Street Map

Now we know the map features we are interested in. We also know what key-value pairs will be used to get this info from OSM. 

We will get our map data from OSM and then save it avoid repeated downloads. So, please copy/paste and run the following commands in your console. 

**Do not run these commands too many times**. **Re-run this  ONLY if you have changed your BOUNDING BOX.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Run these commands in your Console

# Get all buildings within my bbox
dat_buildings <-extract_osm_objects (key = "building", 
                                     bbox = bbox_2)

# Get all residential roads within my bbox
dat_roads <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'highway', 
                                     value = c("residential"),
                                     bbox = bbox_2)

# Get all parks within my bbox
dat_parks <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'park', 
                                  bbox = bbox_2)

# Get all green areas within my bbox
dat_greenery <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'landuse', 
                                  value = 'grass', 
                                  bbox = bbox_2)

dat_trees <- extract_osm_objects (key = 'natural', 
                                  value = 'tree', 
                                  bbox = bbox_2)
```

### Let us save this data, so we don't need to download all this again!

We will store the downloaded data as `.gpkg` files on our local hard drives to use when we run this file again later. 

We will name our stored files as `buildings`, `parks`, `roads`, and `trees`, each with the `.gpkg` file extension, e.g. `trees.gpkg`. 

Check your local project folder for these files after executing these commands. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
st_write(dat_buildings, 
         dsn = "buildings.gpkg", 
         append = FALSE, 
         quiet = FALSE)

st_write(dat_parks, dsn = "parks.gpkg", append = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)
st_write(dat_greenery, dsn = "greenery.gpkg", append = FALSE,quiet = FALSE)
st_write(dat_trees, dsn = "trees.gpkg", append = FALSE,quiet = FALSE)

st_write(dat_roads, dsn = "roads.gpkg", append = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)

```

**Always work from here to avoid repeated downloads from OSM.**
**Start from the top ONLY if you intend to map new locations and need to modify your Bounding Box.**

### Reading Back the saved Data

```{r}
buildings <- st_read("./buildings.gpkg")
parks <- st_read("./parks.gpkg")
greenery <- st_read("./greenery.gpkg")
trees <- st_read("./trees.gpkg")
roads <- st_read("./roads.gpkg")

```


### Let's look at the data

How many rows? ( Rows -> Features )
What kind of `geom` column?

```{r}
# How many buildings?
nrow(buildings)
buildings$geom
class(buildings$geom)
```

So the `buildings` dataset has `r nrow(buildings)` buildings and their geometry is naturally a POLYGON type of geometry column. 


### Your Turn 1

Do this check for all the other spatial data, in the code chunk below. 
What kind of `geom` column does each dataset have?


```{r YOUR-TURN-1, include=TRUE}



```




### What Other Kinds of Data could we get from OSM?

`osm_structures` returns a data.frame of OSM structure types, associated **key-value** pairs and unique suffixes which may be appended to data structures/filenames for storage purposes, and suggested colours.

```{r}
osmplotr::osm_structures()
```

We can use these **key-value** pairs to download different types of map data.


# My first Map in R

There are two ways of plotting maps that we will learn:

## ggplot and geom_sf()

First we will plot with `ggplot` and `geom_sf()` : recall that our data is stored in 5 files: `buildings`, `parks`, `roads`, `trees`, and `greenery`. 

```{r}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = buildings, colour = "orange") +    # POLYGONS
  geom_sf(data = roads, col = "gray20") +           # LINES
  geom_sf(data = parks, col = "darkseagreen1") +    # POLYGONS
  geom_sf(data = greenery, col = "darkseagreen") +  # POLYGONS
  geom_sf(data = trees, col = "green")              # POINTS

```


Note how `geom_sf` is capable of handling *any* geometry in the `sfc` column !! 

> `geom_sf()` is an unusual geom because it will draw different geometric objects depending on what simple features are present in the data: you can get points, lines, or polygons.

So there, we have our first map!


## Map using `tmap` package

We can also create a map using a package called `tmap`. Here we also have the option of making the map *interactive*.

`tmap` plots are made with code in "groups": each group starts with a `tm_shape()` command. 

```{r using tmap}
# Group-1
tm_shape(buildings) +
  tm_fill(col = "mediumblue") +

#Group-2
tm_shape(roads) +
  tm_lines(col = "gold") +

#Group-3  
tm_shape(greenery) +
  tm_polygons(col = "limegreen") +
  
#Group-4  
tm_shape(parks) +
  tm_polygons(col = "limegreen") +

#Group-5  
tm_shape(trees) +
  tm_dots(col = "green")
```


How do we make this map interactive? One more line of code !! Add this line in your console and then run the above chunk again

tmap_mode("view")


# Using data from `tmap`

Like many other packages ( e.g. ggplot ) `tmap` also has a few built-in spatial datasets: `World` and `metro`, `rivers`, `land` and a few others. Check help on these.
Let's plot a first map using datasets built into `tmap`. 

```{r World-Data-tmap}
data("World")
head(World, n = 3)

```

We have several 14 attribute variables in `World`. Attribute variables such as `gdp_cap_est`, `HPI` are numeric. Others such as `income_grp` appear to be factors. 
`iso_a3` is the standard three letter name for the country. 
`name` is of course, the name for each country!


```{r World-metro-cities-tmap}
data("metro")
head(metro, n = 3)

```

Here too we have attribute variables for the metros, and they seem predominantly numeric. Again `iso_a3` is the three letter name for the city.



```{r My-Static-World}
tmap_mode("plot") # Making this a static plot

# Group 1
tm_shape(World) + # dataset = World. 
    tm_polygons("HPI") + # Colour polygons by HPI numeric variable

  # Note the "+" sign continuation
  
# Group 2
tm_shape(metro) + # dataset = metro
  tm_bubbles(size = "pop2030", 
             col = "red") 
# Plot cities as bubbles
# Size proportional to numeric variable `pop2030`
```



```{r My Interactive Water Colour World}
tmap_mode("view") # Change to Interactive


# Let's use WaterColor Map this time!!
tm_tiles("Stamen.Watercolor") + # Watercolor map only with interactive
tm_shape(World) +
    tm_polygons("HPI") + # Color by Happiness Index
  
  
tm_shape(metro) + 
  tm_bubbles(size = "pop2030", # Size City Markers by Population in 2020
             col = "red") 
```

## Using data from `rnaturalearth`

The `rnaturalearth` package allows us to download shapes of countries. We can use it to get borders and also internal state/district boundaries. 

```{r spatial_data}
india <- 
  ne_states(country =  "india", 
            returnclass = "sf") # gives a ready sf dataframe !

india_neighbours <- 
  ne_states(country = (c("sri lanka", "pakistan",
                         "afghanistan", "nepal","bangladesh", "bhutan")
                       ),
            returnclass = "sf")

```


Let's look at the attribute variable columns to colour our graph and to shape our symbols:

```{r}
names(india)
names(india_neighbours)

# Look only at attributes
india %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% head()
india_neighbours%>% st_drop_geometry() %>% head()
```

In the `india` data frame:   
- Column `iso_a2` contains the country name.   
- Column `name` contains the name of the state  

In the `india_neighbours` data frame:   
- Column `gu_a3` contains the country abbreviation  
- Column `name` contains the name of the state  
- Column `iso_3166_2` contains the abbreviation of the state within each neighbouring country.  



### Map 1
```{r Map_1}
tmap_mode("view")

# Plot India
  tm_shape(india) +
  tm_polygons("name", # Colour by States in India
              legend.show = FALSE) +
  
# Plot Neighbours
  tm_shape(india_neighbours) +
  tm_fill(col = "gu_a3") +  # Colour by Country Name
  
# Plot the cities in India alone
  tm_shape(metro %>% dplyr::filter(iso_a3 == "IND")) +
    
  tm_dots(size = "pop2020",legend.size.show = FALSE) +
    # size by population in 2020
    
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE) +
  tm_credits("Geographical Boundaries are not accurate",
             size = 0.5,
             position = "right") +
  tm_compass(position = c("right", "top")) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = "left") +
  tmap_style(style = "classic") 

#Try other map styles
#cobalt #gray #white #watercolor #beaver #classic #watercolor #albatross #bw #col_blind

```


## Your Turn 2

Can you try to download a map area of your home town and plot it as we have above?

```{r Your-Turn-2, include=TRUE}

```


## Adding my favourite Restaurants to the map
Is it time to order on Swiggy...

Let us adding interesting places to our map: say based on your favourite restaurants etc. We need restaurant data: lat/long + name + maybe type of restaurant. This can be manually created ( like all of OSMdata ) or if it is already there we can download using *key-value* pairs in our OSM data query.

Restaurants can be downloaded using `key= "amenity", value = "restaurant"`. Since we want JUST their location, and not the restaurant BUILDINGs, we say `return_type = "points"`.

There are also other tags to explore!Searching for McDonalds for instance...( key = "name", value = "McDonalds")

```{r restaurant-data-1, eval=FALSE}

# Again, run these commands in your Console
dat_R <- extract_osm_objects(bbox = bbox_2, 
                             key = "amenity", 
                             value = "restaurant", 
                             return_type = "point") #<<

# Save the data for future use
write_sf(dat_R, dsn = "restaurants.gpkg",append = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)

```

Note the `return_type` parameter: we want the location and **not** the **building** in which the restaurant is!!

## Reading the saved Restaurant Data

```{r}
restaurants <- st_read("./restaurants.gpkg")
```


How many restaurants have we got?
```{r restaurant-data-2}

restaurants %>% nrow()

```
So the `restaurants`` dataset has `r nrow(restaurants)` restaurants and their geometry is naturally a POINT type of geometry column. 


These are the names of columns in the Restaurant Data: Note the `cuisine` column.

```{r restaurant-data-3}

names(restaurants)

```

So let us plot the restaurants as POINTs using the `restaurants` data we have downloaded. The `cuisine` attribute looks interesting; let us colour the POINT based on the `cuisine` offered at that restaurant. 

So Let's look therefore at the `cuisine` column! 

```{r restaurant-data-4}
# ( I want pizza...)
restaurants$cuisine %>% unique()

```

Big mess...many NAs, some double entries, separated by commas and semicolons....

<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">The `cuisine` attribute:</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
Note: The `cuisine` variable has more than one entry for a given restaurant.  We use `tidyr::separate()` to make multiple columns out of the cuisine column and retain the first one only. 
Since the entries are badly entered using both ";" and "," we need to do this twice ;-()
Bad Data entry!!
  </div>
</div>

Let's get one cuisine entry per restaurant, and drop off the ones that do not mention a cuisine at all:

```{r}
restaurants <- restaurants %>% 
  drop_na(cuisine) %>% # Knock off nondescript restaurants
  
  # Some have more than one classification ;-()
  # Separated by semicolon or comma, so....
  separate(col = cuisine, into = c("cuisine", NA, NA), sep = ";") %>% 
  separate(col = cuisine, into = c("cuisine", NA, NA), sep = ",")

# Finally good food?
restaurants$cuisine
```

Looks clean! Each entry is only ONE and not multiple any more. Now let's plot the Restaurants as POINTs:

```{r}
# http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf
# 
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = buildings, colour = "burlywood1") +
  geom_sf(data = roads, colour = "gray80") +
  geom_sf(
    data = restaurants %>% drop_na(cuisine),
    aes(fill = cuisine),
    colour = "black",
    shape = 21,
    size = 3
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(title = "Restaurants in South Central Bangalore",
       caption = "Based on osmdata")
```


We could have done a (much!) better job, by combining cuisines into simpler and fewer categories, ( South_India and South_Indian ), but that is for another day!! 

By now we know that we can use `geom_sf()` multiple number of times with different datasets to create layered maps in R.

# Using `leaflet` directly to make interactive maps

# Some fancy stuff
Let us try making glob based maps with the package `threejs`. This package is one of the family of packages in the `htmlwidgets` group of packages. It allows the use of some ( famous!) JavaScript graphing libraries directly and natively in R. 

## `globejs` usage
The `globejs` command from the package `threejs` allows one to plot points, arcs and images on a globe in 3D. The globe can be rotated and and zoomed. Great Circles and historical routes are a good idea for this perhaps.

Refer to this page for more ideas <http://bwlewis.github.io/rthreejs/globejs.html>

We will generate some random locations and plot them on the 3D globe.

```{r}
# Random Lats and Longs
lat <- rpois(10, 60) + rnorm(10, 80)
long <- rpois(10, 60) + rnorm(10, 10)

# Random "Spike" heights for each location. Population? Tourists? GDP?
value <- rpois(10, lambda = 80)
 
globejs(lat = lat, long = long)

```

As seen, "spikes" are created at the random lat-lon locations. We can control the height/width/colour of the spikes, as well as the initial view of the globe itself: zoom, location and so on


```{r}
globejs(
  lat = lat,
  long = long,
  
  # random heights of the Spikes (!!) at lat-long combo
  value = value,
  color = "red",
  # Zoom factor, default is 35
  fov = 50
)
```


```{r}
globejs(
  lat = lat,
  long = long,
  value = value,
  color = "red",
  pointsize = 4, # width of the columns
  # Zoom position
  fov = 35,
  # initial position of the globe
  rotationlat = 0.6, #  in RADIANS !!! Good Heavens!!
  rotationlong = 0.2 #  in RADIANS !!! Good Heavens!!
)
```


```{r}
globejs(
  lat = lat,
  long = long,
  value = value,
  color = "red",
  pointsize = 4,
  fov = 35,
  rotationlat = 0.6,
  rotationlong = 0.2,
  lightcolor = "#aaeeff",
  emissive = "#0000ee",
  bodycolor = "#ffffff",
  bg = "grey"
)

```
