# Introduction

This RMarkdown document is part of the Generic Skills Component  (GSK) of the Course of the  Foundation Studies Programme at Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, Bangalore India. The material is based on *A Layered Grammar of Graphics* by Hadley Wickham. The course is meant for First Year students pursuing a Degree in Art and Design. 

The intent of this GSK part is to build Skill in coding in R, and also appreciate R as a way to metaphorically visualize information of various kinds, using predominantly geometric figures and structures.

All RMarkdown files combine code, text, web-images, and figures developed using code. Everything is text; code chunks are enclosed in **fences** (```)

# Goals

- (Re)Understand different kinds of data variables
- Appreciate how they can be identified based on the *Interrogative Pronouns* they answer to
- Understand how each kind of variable lends itself to a specific choice of **colour scale** in the data visualization.


# Pedagogical Note

The method followed will be based on
[PRIMM](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/cser/2017/09/01/primm-a-structured-approach-to-teaching-programming/):

-   **PREDICT** Inspect the code and guess at what the code might do,
    **write predictions**
-   **RUN** the code provided and check what happens
-   **INFER** what the `parameters` of the code do and **write comments to explain**. What bells and whistles can you see?
-   **MODIFY** the `parameters` code provided to understand the
    `options` available. **Write comments** to show what you have aimed for and achieved.
-   **MAKE** : take an idea/concept of your own, and graph it.

In the following, there is some boiler plate code demonstrating the use of colour palettes in R. There are places where **YOUR TURN** is mention; copy and play with the boiler plate code to see what happens !

# Data

We will use the `penguins` dataset built into the `palmerpenguins` package. Your should try other datasets too!

Here is a glimpse of the data:

```{r}

glimpse(penguins)

```

Note that the unit of observation here is one-row-per-penguin.

Variables you need for this lab:

# Colour vs fill aesthetic

Fill and colour scales in ggplot2 can use the same palettes. Some shapes such as lines only accept the colour aesthetic, while others, such as polygons, accept both colour and fill aesthetics. In the latter case, the colour refers to the border of the shape, and the fill to the interior.



```{r}

## A look at all 25 symbols
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5,
                 y = rep(rev(seq(0, 24, by = 5)), each = 5),
                 z = 1:25)
s <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = z, y = y - 1)) +
  theme_void()
s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 4) + scale_shape_identity()

```


All symbols have a foreground colour, so if we add `color = "navy"`, they all are affected.

```{r}

s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 4, colour = "blue")  + scale_shape_identity()

```


While all symbols have a foreground colour, symbols 21-25 also take a background colour (fill). So if we add `fill = "orchid"`, only the last row of symbols are affected.

```{r}

s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 4, colour = "blue", fill = "orchid")  + scale_shape_identity()

```


# Discrete vs continuous variables

[WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CATEGORICAL, ORDINAL AND INTERVAL VARIABLES?](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/what-is-the-difference-between-categorical-ordinal-and-interval-variables/)

In order to use color with your data, most importantly, you need to know if youâ€™re dealing with discrete or continuous variables. 


## Some Colour Palette Packages in R

We have the following example packages that offer palettes in R:

- `RColorBrewer`
- `wesanderson`
- `paletteer`
- `colorspace`

See Appendix for a detailed graphical analysis of these palette packages. 


## Colour Palette Types

These palettes can be:

> **Sequential** (type = "seq") palettes are suited to ordered data that progress from low to high. Lightness steps dominate the look of these schemes, with light colors for low data values to dark colors for high data values. (for **numerical** data, that are ordered)

> **Diverging** (type = "div") palettes put equal emphasis on mid-range critical values and extremes at both ends of the data range. The critical class or break in the middle of the legend is emphasized with light colors and low and high extremes are emphasized with dark colors that have contrasting hues.(for **numerical data that can be positive or negative**, often representing deviations from some norm or baseline)

> **Qualitative** (type = "qual") palettes do not imply magnitude differences between legend classes, and hues are used to create the primary visual differences between classes. Qualitative schemes are best suited to representing **nominal or categorical** data. (for qualitative unordered data)


## Create a simple set of scatter plots

We will create simple base plots in `ggplot` and see how we may alter the colour scales using palettes.


```{r penguin_names }

names(penguins)

```


```{r Penguins_default_simple_plots}

p1 <- penguins %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  # pipe data into ggplot
  # after removing data rows that have missing ( NA ) values
  ggplot(aes(y = body_mass_g, x = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = species # COLOUR = DISCRETE/QUAL VARIABLE
           )) +
           geom_point() + 
           labs(title = "Default Colours in ggplot", 
                subtitle = "P1: DISCRETE/QUAL Colour Palette")


p2 <- 
penguins %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  # pipe the data into ggplot, 
  # after removing data rows that have missing ( NA ) values
  ggplot(aes(y = body_mass_g, x = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = bill_length_mm # COLOUR = CONT/QUANT VARIABLE
           )) +
           geom_point() + 
           labs(title = "Default Colours in ggplot", 
                subtitle = "P2: CONTINUOUS/QUANT Colour Palette")

p1
p2

```

Note that these use the **default colours** in R. 

# Colours for **Discrete** (**QUAL**) Variables

The commands below are used to fill colours based on Qualitative Variables:

1) `scale_colour/fill_discrete`
2) `scale_colour/fill_brewer` # RColorBrewer
3) ....


Now to use these!

# Plotting Colours based on Discrete Variables

## Discrete n-Colour palettes from `RColorBrewer`

```{r brewer_palettes}

RColorBrewer::brewer.pal.info
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()

```


```{r Applying_RColorBrewer_Discrete_palettes}

p1 +
  # default palette = "Blues"
  scale_colour_brewer() +
  labs(title = "Brewer Palette = Blues")

p1 +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  labs(title = "Brewer Palette = Spectral") 


```


```{r YOUR_TURN_1}

```


## Discrete Colour scales using `wesanderson` palettes

```{r wesander_list}

wesanderson::wes_palettes %>% names()

```


```{r wesanderson_discrete}

p1 +
  scale_colour_discrete(type = wes_palette(name = "GrandBudapest1",
                                           n = 3)) +
  labs(title = "Wes Anderson Palette: GrandBudapest")


# We can also specify colour codes ourselves with scale_x_discrete.
# Use argument "values" instead of "type"
manual_colours <- c("#afc4b8", "#f1a4b2", "#ffb1e1") 
manual_colours

p1 +
  scale_colour_manual(values =  manual_colours) +
  labs(title = "Manual Colours")

```



```{r YOUR_TURN_2}

```

## Discrete n-Colour palettes from `RColorBrewer`

```{r Brewer-discrete}

# scale_x_brewer() for DISCRETE data
p1 +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  
  labs(title = "RColorBrewer Palette = Spectral")

```



```{r YOUR_TURN_3}

```


## Discrete Colour scales using `paletteer` palettes

```{r paletteer discrete}

palettes_d_names
palettes_dynamic_names
paletteer_d("dutchmasters::pearl_earring")
paletteer_dynamic("ggthemes_ptol::qualitative", n = 3)

p1 +
  scale_colour_paletteer_d("ggthemes_ptol::qualitative", 
                           dynamic = TRUE) +
  
  labs(title = "ggThemes Palette: Qualitative", 
          subtitle = "")


# I like Vermeer's "Girl with the Pearl Earring"!
p1 +
  scale_colour_paletteer_d("dutchmasters::pearl_earring",
                           dynamic = FALSE) +
  
  labs(title = "Palettes from `paletteer`", 
          subtitle = " Palette from Vermeer: Girl with Pearl Earring")
  

```


```{r YOUR_TURN_4}

```



# Colours for **Continuous** (**QUANT**) Variables

The commands below are used to fill colours based on Quantitative Variables:

1) `scale_colour/fill_gradient` (Two colour gradient)
2) `scale_colour/fill_gradient2` (Three colour gradient)
3) `scale_colour/fill_gradientn` (Specify Palette, from other packages also, like `wesanderson` )
4) `scale_colour/fill_distiller` (Palettes from RColorBrewer)


# Plotting Colours based on Continuous Variables


## Continuous Two Colour Gradients

Creates a pallete containing *continuous* shades between two colours:

```{r Continuous_Two_Colour_Gradients}

p2 +
    scale_color_gradient(
      low = "yellow", # Play with this in the chunk below
      high = "purple") + # Play with this in the chnk below
  
  labs(title = "Two Colour Gradients",
          subtitle = "P2: Continuous 2-Colour Pallete")

```

```{r YOUR_TURN_5}

```


## Continuous Three Colour Gradients

Sometimes we want a palette this way: a *midpoint* colour, and colours for the two extremes of a continuous variable:

```{r Continuous_Three_Colour_Gradients}

colour_midpoint <- mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, 
                         na.rm = TRUE) # remove missing values
# Struggled all morning on 22 Aug 2020 to get at this ;-D

# Play with the function: 0/mean/median/mode/max/min

p2 +
  scale_colour_gradient2(
  low = "brown", # Play with this in the chunk below
  mid = "white", # Play with this in the chunk below
  high = "purple", # Play with this in the chunk below
  midpoint = colour_midpoint, # see above
  space = "Lab", # don't mess with this!
  na.value = "grey50")  +
  labs(title = "Three colour continuous gradient", 
          subtitle = "Mid Colour mapped to midpoint of data variable",
          caption = "Colours inspired by my favourite cocker spaniel, Lord Chestnut") # Play with these

```

```{r YOUR_TURN_6}

```

## Continuous n-Colour Gradients - grDevices package


```{r Continuous_n_Colour_Gradients_grDevices}

# grDevices Palettes
p2 +
  scale_colour_gradientn(
    colours = terrain.colors(10)) +
  # Try these:
  # heat.colors() / topo.colors() / cm.colors() / rainbow()
  
  labs(title = "N-colour continuous gradients", 
          subtitle = "Palettes from grDevices",
          caption = "Palette: terrain.colors")

```


```{r YOUR_TURN_7}

```


## Continuous n-Colour Gradients - `wesanderson` Palettes

```{r wesanderson}

wes_palettes
names(wes_palettes)

```

```{r Using_wesanderson}

p2 +
    scale_colour_gradientn(
      colors = wes_palette(name = "GrandBudapest1", 
                           n = 4), # Keep an eye on "n".
      na.value = "grey") +
  # Try these:
  # "BottleRocket1"  "BottleRocket2"  "Rushmore1"
  # "Rushmore"       "Royal1"         "Royal2"
  # "Zissou1"        "Darjeeling1"    "Darjeeling2"   
  # "Chevalier1"     "FantasticFox1"  "Moonrise1"     
  # "Moonrise2"      "Moonrise3"      "Cavalcanti1"   
  # "GrandBudapest1" "GrandBudapest2" "IsleofDogs1"   
  # "IsleofDogs2"   
  # Keep an eye on "n".
  
  labs(title = "N-colour continuous gradients", 
       subtitle = "Palettes from wesanderson",
       caption = "Palette: GrandBudapest1") # Change this caption based on palette choice

```

```{r YOUR_TURN_8}

```


## Continuous n-Colour palettes from `RColorBrewer`

Recall Palette **types**

- `seq` for continuous data mapped to colour
- `qual` for categorical data mapped to colour ( discrete)
- `div` continuous data mapped to colour, that has pos and neg extremes from a middle value


```{r brewer_palette_names}

brewer.pal.info

```


```{r Using_Color_Brewer_palettes}

# scale_color_distiller() and scale_fill_distiller() 
# are used to apply the ColorBrewer colour scales 
# to continuous data.

p2 +
  scale_colour_distiller(
    palette = "YlGnBu") + # Play with this palette
  
  labs(title = "RColorBrewer Palette")

```

```{r YOUR_TURN_9}

```

## Continuous Colour scales using `paletteer` palettes

This palette seems to have everything accessible in a simple way!
NOTE: In order to access some palettes in `paletteer`, you may be asked to install other packages. E.g. `harrypotter` or `scico`. These need not be brought into your session using `library()` but are accessed directly by `paletteer` which is very convenient!!

```{r paletteer_continupus_palettes_list}

# What continuous palettes are there in paletteer?
paletteer::palettes_c_names

```


OK, one of the Games of Thrones Palettes, and Harry Potter! 

```{r paletteer_continuous_palettes}

p2 +
  scale_colour_paletteer_c("gameofthrones::jon_snow") +
  labs(title = "Using Paletteer",
       subtitle = "Continuous Palette-Game of Thrones: Jon Snow",
       caption = "Oh you awful Srishti people...") +
  
  # Harry Potter Gryffindor Palette.
  # Will ask for `harrypotter` package to be installed. Say yes!
  p2 +
  scale_colour_paletteer_c("harrypotter::gryffindor") +
  labs(title = "Using Paletteer",
       subtitle = "Continuous Palette-Harry Potter:Gryffindor")

```

```{r YOUR_TURN_10}

```
