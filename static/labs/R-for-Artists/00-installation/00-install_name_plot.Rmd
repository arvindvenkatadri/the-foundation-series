# Goals

At the end of this Lab, we will:

- have installed R and RStudio on our machines
- understood how to add additional R-packages for specific features and graphic capability
- run code within RStudio and interpret the results
- have learnt to look for help within R and RStudio

# Instructions

1. Keep this tab open in your browser as you work through it. Read all the way to the end.


# Overview

This guide will lead you through the steps to install and use [R, a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics.](https://www.r-project.org) 


What is R?

* **R** is the name of the programming language itself, based off S from Bell Labs, which users access through a command-line interpreter (`>`)

What is RStudio?

* **RStudio** is a powerful and convenient user interface that allows you to access the R programming language along with a lot of other bells and whistles that enhance functionality (and sanity). 

Our end goal is to get you looking at a screen like this:

# Install R

Install R from [CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.rstudio.com). Please choose a **precompiled binary distribution** for your operating system.

## Check in

Launch R. You should see one console with a command line interpreter (`>`). Close R.

# Install RStudio 

Install the free, open-source edition of RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

RStudio provides a powerful user interface for R, called an *integrated development environment*. RStudio includes:

* a console (the standard command line interface: `>`), 
* a syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and 
* tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.


## Check in

Launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-workbench.png), but yours will be empty. Look at the bottom left pane: this is the same console window you saw when you opened R in step 1.15. 

* Place your cursor where you see `>` and type `x <- 2 + 2`, hit enter or return, then type `x`, and hit enter/return again. 
* If `[1] 4` prints to the screen, you have successfully installed R and RStudio, and you can move onto installing packages.

# Install packages

The version of R that you just downloaded is considered base R, which provides you with good but basic statistical computing and graphics powers. For analytical and graphical super-powers, you'll need to install add-on packages, which are user-written, to extend/expand your R capabilities. Packages can live in one of two places:

* They may be carefully curated by CRAN (which involves a thorough submission and review process), and thus are easy install using `install.packages("name_of_package", dependencies = TRUE)` in your CONSOLE. 

Place your cursor in the CONSOLE again (where you last typed `x` and `[4]` printed on the screen). You can use the first method to install the following packages directly from CRAN, all of which we will use:

  * [`knitr`,](https://yihui.org/knitr/)
  * [`dplyr`,](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org)
  * [`ggplot2`,](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
  * [`babynames`](https://github.com/hadley/babynames)

* To *install* a package, you put the name of the package **in quotes** as in `install.packages("name_of_package")`. 
Mind your use of quotes carefully with packages.

* To *use* an already installed package, you must load it first, as in `library(name_of_package)`, leaving the name of the package bare. You only need to do this **once** per RStudio session.
  
You can download all of these at once, too:

```{r c_install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("knitr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "babynames"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

A brief aside: 
`c()` is a command in R that allows us to combine things into a `vector` ( one of the ways data is represented in R)

```{r c_demo}
c("hello", "my", "name", "is", "arvind")
c(1:3, 20, 50)

```


* If you want *help*, no quotes are needed: `help(name_of_package)` or `?name_of_package`.
* If you want the *citation* for a package (and you should give credit where credit is due), ask R as in `citation("name_of_package")`.

```{r show_dplyr, eval = F}
install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
help("dplyr")
```

```{r help_dplyr}
citation("ggplot2")
```

# Make a name plot

The webpage you are looking at is derived from a `R Markdown` doc that you can download, edit and compute with. We will meet `R Markdown` in the next class. 

Download this .Rmd file using the `Code->Download Rmd` button at the top right corner.

Change the author name to your own!

Hit the green "play" button to run this "load_packages" *chunk* to include in your R session all the installed packages you need: 

```{r load_packages, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE, comment = NA, warnings = FALSE, errors = FALSE, messages = FALSE, tidy = FALSE)
library(knitr) # to use this....document! More later!!
library(dplyr) # for manipulating data
library(ggplot2) # for plotting data
library(babynames) # A package containing, yes, Baby Names

```

Let us greet our data first !!

```{r hlo_dataset}
glimpse(babynames) # dplyr
head(babynames) # base R
tail(babynames) # same
names(babynames) # same
```


If you have done the above and produced sane-looking output, you are ready for the next bit. Use the code below to create a new data frame called `arvind`. 

```{r manipulate_name_data}
my_name_data <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Arvind" | name == "Aravind") %>% 
  filter(sex == "M") 
```

* The first bit makes a new dataset called `my_name_data` that is a copy of the `babynames` dataset- the `%>%` tells you we are doing some other stuff to it later.

* The second bit `filters` our `babynames` to only keep rows where the `name` is either Arvind or Aravind (read `|` as _"or"_.) 

* The third bit applies another `filter` to keep only those where sex is male.

Let's check out the data.

```{r}
my_name_data
glimpse(my_name_data)
```

Again, if you have sane-looking output here, move along to plotting the data!

```{r plot_name_data}

plot <- ggplot(my_name_data, aes(x = year, 
                           y = prop,  
                           group = name, 
                           color = name)) + 
  geom_line()

```

Now if you did this right, you will **not see** your plot!

Because we saved the `ggplot` with a name (`plot`), R just saved the object for you. But check out the top right pane in RStudio again: under the `Environment` pane you should see `plot`, so it is there, you just have to ask for it. Here's how:

```{r}

plot 

```

# Make a new name plot

Edit my code above to create a new dataset. Pick 2 names to compare how popular they each are (these could be different spellings of your own name, like I did, but you can choose any 2 names that are present in the dataset). Make the new plot, changing the name of the first argument `arvind` in `ggplot()` to the name of your new dataset.


## Save and share 

Save your work so you can share your favorite plot with us. You will not like the looks of your plot if you mouse over to `Export` and save it. Instead, use `ggplot2`'s command for saving a plot with sensible defaults:

```{r eval = FALSE}

help(ggsave)

```

```{r eval = F}

ggsave("file_name_here.pdf", plot) # please make the filename unique!

```

Upload this exported plot to Teams -> Assignments. 

**Before you do that**, check that you can submit stuff/assignments on Teams by uploading a cat picture first, especially if you are an **ailurophile** like me. (Acceptable Breeds: Scottish Folds or Maine Coons)
