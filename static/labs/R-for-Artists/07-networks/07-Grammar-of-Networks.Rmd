# Introduction

This RMarkdown document is part of the Generic Skills Component (GSK) of
the Course of the Foundation Studies Programme at Srishti Manipal
Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, Bangalore India. The material
is based on *A Layered Grammar of Graphics* by Hadley Wickham. The
course is meant for First Year students pursuing a Degree in Art and
Design.

The intent of this GSK part is to build Skill in coding in R, and also
appreciate R as a way to metaphorically visualize information of various
kinds, using predominantly geometric figures and structures.

All RMarkdown files combine code, text, web-images, and figures
developed using code. Everything is text; code chunks are enclosed in
**fences** (\`\`\`)

# Goals

At the end of this Lab session, we should:

-   know the types and structures of `network data` and be able to work
    with them
-   understand the basics of modern network packages in R
-   be able to create network visualizations using `tidygraph`,
    `ggraph`( static visualizations ) and `visNetwork` (interactive
    visualizations)
-   see directions for how the network metaphor applies in a variety of
    domains (e.g. biology/ecology, ideas/influence, technology,
    transportation, to name a few)

# Pedagogical Note

The method followed will be based on
[PRIMM](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/cser/2017/09/01/primm-a-structured-approach-to-teaching-programming/):

-   **PREDICT** Inspect the code and guess at what the code might do,
    **write predictions**
-   **RUN** the code provided and check what happens
-   **INFER** what the `parameters` of the code do and **write comments
    to explain**. What bells and whistles can you see?
-   **MODIFY** the `parameters` code provided to understand the
    `options` available. **Write comments** to show what you have aimed
    for and achieved.
-   **MAKE** : take an idea/concept of your own, and graph it.

# Set Up

The `setup` code **chunk** below brings into our coding session **R
packages** that provide specific computational abilities and also
**datasets** which we can use.

To reiterate: Packages and datasets are **not** the same thing !!
Packages are (small) collections of programs. Datasets are
just....information.

# Graph Metaphors

Network graphs are characterized by two key terms: **nodes** and
**edges**

1.  `Nodes` : **Entities**

    -   Metaphors: Individual People? Things? Ideas? Places? to be
        connected in the network.
    -   Synonyms: `vertices`. Nodes have `IDs`.

2.  `Edges`: **Connections**

    -   Metaphors: Interactions? Relationships? Influence? Letters sent
        and received? Dependence? between the entities.
    -   Synonyms: `links`, `ties`.

In R, we create network representations using node and edge information.
*One way* in which these could be organized are:

-   `Node list`: a data frame with a single column listing the node IDs
    found in the edge list. You can also add **attribute columns** to
    the data frame such as the names of the nodes or grouping variables.

|     |            |                                                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| ID  | Node Name  | Attribute? Qualities? Categories? Family? Country? Planet? Race? |
| 1   | Ned        | Nursery School Teacher                                           |
| 2   | Jaguar Paw | Main Character in Apocalypto                                     |
| 3   | John Snow  | Epidemiologist                                                   |

: Node Table

-   `Edge list`: data frame containing two columns: **source node** and
    **destination node** of an `edge`. Source and Destination have
    `node IDs`.
-   `Weighted network graph`: An edge list can also contain additional
    columns describing attributes of the edges such as a magnitude
    aspect for an edge. If the edges have a magnitude attribute the
    graph is considered weighted.

|      |     |                    |        |
|------|-----|--------------------|--------|
| From | To  | Relationship       | Weight |
| 1    | 3   | Financial Dealings | 6      |
| 2    | 1   | History Lessons    | 2      |
| 2    | 3   | Vaccination        | 15     |

: Edges Table

-   `Layout`: A **geometric** arrangement of `nodes` and `edges`.

    -   Metaphors: Location? Spacing? Distance? Coordinates? Colour?
        Shape? Size? Provides visual insight due to the `arrangement`.

-   `Layout Algorithms` : `Method` to arranges `nodes` and `edges` with
    the aim of optimizing some `metric` .

    -   Metaphors: Nodes are `masses` and edges are `springs`. The
        Layout algorithm minimizes the stretching and compressing of all
        springs.(BTW, are the Spring Constants K the same for all
        springs?...)

8.  `Directed and undirected network graph`: If the distinction between
    source and target is meaningful, the network is **directed.**

    If the distinction is not meaningful, the network is **undirected**.

    **Directed edges** represent an ordering of nodes, like a
    relationship extending from one node to another, where switching the
    direction would change the structure of the network.

    **Undirected edges** are simply links between nodes where order does
    not matter.

Examples:

-   The World Wide Web is an example of a **directed network** because
    hyperlinks connect one Web page to another, but not necessarily the
    other way around.

-   Co-authorship networks represent examples of **un-directed
    networks**, where nodes are authors and they are connected by an
    edge if they have written a publication together

-   When people send e-mail to each other, the distinction between the
    sender (source) and the recipient (target) is clearly meaningful,
    therefore the network is directed.

9.  `Connected` and `Disconnected` graphs: If there is *some* path from
    *any node* to *any other node*, the Networks is said to be
    Connected. Else, Disconnected.

# Predict/Run/Infer -1

## Using `tidygraph` and `ggraph`

`tidygraph` and `ggraph` are modern R packages for network data. Graph
Data setup and manipulation is done in `tidygraph` and graph
visualization with `ggraph`.

-   `tidygraph` Node + Edge Data -\> "Network Object" in R.
-   `ggraph` Network Object -\> Plots using a chosen layout/algo.

Both leverage the power of **`igraph`**, which is the **Big Daddy** of
all network packages. We will be using the *Grey's Anatomy dataset* in
our first foray into networks.

## Step1. Read the data

```{r 1.Read-greys-anatomy-data, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}

grey_nodes <- read_csv("data/grey_nodes.csv")
grey_edges <- read_csv("data/grey_edges.csv")


# grey_nodes <- read_delim("./Data/greys-nodes.csv", delim = ";")
# ger_edges <- read_delim("~/Downloads/grey-edges.csv", 
#     delim = ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
grey_nodes
grey_edges

```

```{r, for-teaching-only, echo=FALSE}
grey_nodes %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "greys-nodes",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download Grey Nodes as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )

grey_edges %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "greys-edges",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download Grey Edges data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )

```

Save these two CSV files in your project's `data` folder.

NOTE: these are actually **semicolon separated values** files, so our
familiar `read_csv()` will not work. We will need to use `read_delim()`
and use the argument `delim = ";"` .

Remove the `eval = FALSE` in the code chunk options below:

```{r read-data, eval=FALSE}
grey_nodes <- read_delim("data/grey_nodes.csv",delim = ";")
grey_edges <- read_delim("data/grey_edges.csv", delim = ";")

```

Let's look at what we have read in:

```{r}
grey_nodes
grey_edges

```

### Questions and Inferences #1:

Look at the console output thumbnail. What attributes (i.e. extra
information columns) are seen for Nodes and Edges? Understand the data
in both nodes and edges as shown in the second and third thumbnails.
Write some comments and inferences here.

## Step 2.Create a network object using `tidygraph`:

Key function:

-   `tbl_graph()`: (aka "tibble graph").
-   Key arguments: `nodes`, `edges` and `directed`.
-   Note this is a very versatile command and can take many input forms,
    such as data structures that result from other packages. Type
    `?tbl_graph` in the Console and see the `Usage` section.

NOTE: `ggplot` needs a dataframe/tibble to start its plotting, as you
recall. The graph plotting package equivalent of `ggplot` is `ggraph`.
It needs a *"dataframe"* that is suitable for **network plotting**. This
is the **network object** created by `tidygraph`.

```{r 2.Create-greys-anatomy-graph-object}
ga <- tbl_graph(nodes = grey_nodes, 
                edges = grey_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
ga

```

### Questions and Inferences #2:

What new information does the graph object contain? Have the attributes
of the nodes and edges been properly included?

## Step 3. Plot using `ggraph`

3a. Quick Plot: `autograph()` This is to check quickly is the data is
imported properly and to decide upon going on to a more elaborate
plotting.

```{r 3a.Auto-graph-greys-anatomy}

autograph(ga)

```

### Questions and Inferences #3:

Describe this graph, in simple words here. Try to use some of the new
domain words we have just acquired: *nodes/edges,
connected/disconnected, directed/undirected*.

3b. More elaborate plot

Key functions:

-   `ggraph(layout = "......")`: Create classic node-edge diagrams; i.e.
    Sets up the graph. Rather like `ggplot` for networks!

Two kinds of `geom`: one set for nodes, and another for edges

-   `geom_node_point(aes(.....))`: Draws node as "points". Alternatives
    are `circle / arc_bar / tile / voronoi`. Remember the `geom`s that
    we have seen before in Grammar of Graphics!

-   `geom_edge_link(aes(.....))`: Draws edges as "links". Alternatives
    are
    `arc / bend / elbow / hive / loop / parallel / diagonal / point / span /tile`.

-   `geom_node_text(aes(label = ......), repel = TRUE)`: Adds text
    labels (non-overlapping). Alternatives are `label /...`

-   `labs(title = "....", subtitle = "....", caption = "....")`: Change
    main titles, axis labels and legend titles. We know this from our
    work with `ggplot`.

```{r 3b.Ggraph-greys-anatomy}

# Write Comments next to each line 
# About what that line does for the overall graph

ggraph(graph = ga,  layout = "kk") +
  #
  
  geom_edge_link(width = 2, 
                 color = "pink") +
  #
  
  geom_node_point(
    shape = 21,
    size = 6,
    fill = "blue",
    color = "green",
    stroke = 2
  ) +
  #
  
  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My first silly Grey's Anatomy graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did Kumar put me in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are doing **cool** things in the other classes...")



```

### Questions and Inferences #4:

What parameters have been changed here, compared to the earlier graph?
Where do you see these changes in the code above?

Let us **Play** with this graph and see if we can make some small
changes. Colour? Fill? Width? Size? Stroke? Labels? Of course!

```{r 3c.Modify-Greys-Anatomy-ggraph}
# Change the parameters in each of the commands here to new ones
# Use fixed values for colours or sizes...etc. 

ggraph(graph = ga,  layout = "kk") + 
  geom_edge_link(width = 1,
                 color = "springgreen2") + 
  geom_node_point(shape = 25, 
                  size = 4, 
                  fill = "burlywood", 
                  color = "firebrick", 
                  stroke = 1) +
  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My next silly Grey's Anatomy graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did Kumar put me in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are still doing cool things in the other classes...")



```

### Questions and Inferences #5: 

What did the `shape` parameter achieve? What are the possibilities with
`shape`? How about including `alpha`?

3c. Aesthetic Mapping from Node and Edge attribute columns

Up to now, we have **assigned** *specific numbers* to geometric
aesthetics such as shape and size. Now we are ready ( maybe ?) change
the meaning and significance of the entire graph and each element within
it, and use **aesthetics / metaphoric mappings** to achieve new meanings
or insights. Let us try using `aes()` inside each `geom` to map a
`variable` to a geometric aspect.

Don't try to use more than 2 aesthetic mappings simultaneously!!

The node elements we can tweak are:

-   Types of Nodes: `geom_node_****()`
-   Node Parameters: inside `geom_node_****(aes(...............))`
    -   `aes(alpha  = node-variable)` : opacity; a value between 0 and 1

    -   `aes(shape  = node-variable)` : node shape

    -   `aes(colour = node-variable)` : node colour

    -   `aes(fill   = node-variable)` : fill colour for node

    -   `aes(size   = node-variable)` : size of node

The edge elements we can tweak are:

-   Type of Edges" `geom_edge_****()`
-   Edge Parameters: inside `geom_edge_****(aes(...............))`
    -   `aes(colour = edge-variable)` : colour of the edge

    -   `aes(width  = edge-variable)` : width of the edge

    -   `aes(label  = some_variable)` : labels for the edge

Type `?geom_node_point` and `?geom-edge_link` in your Console for more
information.

```{r 3d.aesthetics-using-ggraph-Modify}

# Look at the column names for Edges and Nodes again. 
# Which column is which kind ( Qual or Quant?)
names(grey_edges)
names(grey_nodes)

# OK, let's modify some aesthetics
# 
ggraph(graph = ga, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight)) + # add mapping here
  
  geom_node_point(aes(color = race), size = 6) + # add mapping here

  # geom_node_label(aes(label = name), # modify this mapping
  #                 repel = TRUE, max.overlaps = 20,
  #                 alpha = 0.6,
  #                 size = 3) +

  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! Yet another Grey's Anatomy graph in R!")

```

### Questions and Inferences #6:

Describe some of the changes here. What types of edges worked? Which
variables were you able to use for nodes and edges and how? What did not
work with either of the two?

## Playing with Layout

```{r arc-diagram}
# Arc diagram
ggraph(ga, layout = "linear") +
  geom_edge_arc(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 2)) +
  geom_node_point(size = 2, colour = "red") +
  labs(edge_width = "Weight") +
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "top")


```



### Questions and Inferences #7:

How does this graph look "metaphorically" different? Do you see a
difference in the relationships between people here? Why?

```{r Coord-Diagram-circular}
# Coord diagram, circular
ggraph(ga, layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + # Seems weird? ;-D
  geom_edge_arc(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 2)) +
  geom_node_point(size = 4,colour = "red") + 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name),repel = TRUE, 
                 size = 3,
                 max.overlaps = 20) +
  labs(edge_width = "Weight") +
  
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        aspect.ratio = 1)

```

### Questions and Inferences #8:

How does this graph look "metaphorically" different? Do you see a
difference in the relationships between people here? Why?

# Hierarchical layouts

These provide for some alternative metaphorical views of networks. Note
that not all layouts are possible for all datasets!!

```{r}
# setting theme_graph from ggraph
set_graph_style()

# This dataset contains the graph that describes the class 
# hierarchy for the Flare visualization library.
# Type ?flare in your Console
head(flare$vertices)
head(flare$edges)

# flare class hierarchy
graph = tbl_graph(edges = flare$edges, nodes = flare$vertices)

# dendrogram
ggraph(graph, layout = "dendrogram") + 
  geom_edge_diagonal() + 
  labs(title = "Dendrogram")

# circular dendrogram
ggraph(graph, layout = "dendrogram", circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_diagonal() + 
  geom_node_point(aes(filter = leaf)) + 
  coord_fixed()+ 
  labs(title = "Circular Dendrogram")

# rectangular tree map
ggraph(graph, layout = "treemap", weight = size) + 
  geom_node_tile(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25) + 
  labs(title = "Rectangular Tree Map")

# circular tree map
ggraph(graph, layout = "circlepack", weight = size) + 
  geom_node_circle(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25, n = 50) + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  labs(title = "Circular Tree Map")

# icicle
ggraph(graph, layout = "partition") + 
  geom_node_tile(aes(y = -y, fill = depth))

# sunburst (circular icicle)
ggraph(graph, layout = "partition", circular = TRUE) +
  geom_node_arc_bar(aes(fill = depth)) +
  coord_fixed() + 
  labs(title = "Circular Icicle")
```

### Questions and Inferences #9:

How do graphs look "metaphorically" different? Do they reveal different
aspects of the group? How?

## Faceting

Faceting allows to create sub-plots according to the values of a
qualitative attribute on nodes or edges.

```{r faceting}
# setting theme_graph 
set_graph_style()


# facet edges by type
ggraph(ga,layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(color = type)) + 
  geom_node_point() +
  facet_edges(~ type)

# facet nodes by sex
ggraph(ga,layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_link() + 
  geom_node_point() +
  facet_nodes(~race)

# facet both nodes and edges
ggraph(ga,layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(color = type)) + 
  geom_node_point() +
  facet_graph(type ~ race) + 
  th_foreground(border = TRUE)
```

### Questions and Inferences #10: 

Does splitting up the main graph into sub-networks give you more
insight? Describe some of these.

# Network analysis with `tidygraph`

The data frame graph representation can be easily augmented with
**metrics** or **statistics** computed on the graph. Remember how we
computed `counts` with the penguin dataset in Grammar of Graphics.

Before computing a metric on nodes or edges use the `activate()`
function to activate either node or edge data frames. Use `dplyr`
**verbs** (`filter, arrange, mutate`) to achieve your computation in the
proper way.

## Network Centrality

Centrality is a an "ill-defined" metric of **node and edge importance**
in a network. It is therefore calculated in many ways.

Type `?centrality` in your Console.

![Standards](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

Let's add a few columns to the nodes and edges based on network
centrality measures:

```{r network-analysis-1}
ga_centrality <- ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  
  # Most connections?
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = c("in"))) %>% 
  filter(degree > 0) %>% 
  
  activate(edges) %>% 
  # "Busiest" edge?
  mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness())

ga_centrality %>% activate(nodes) %>% as_tibble()
ga_centrality %>% activate(edges) %>% as_tibble()


```

Let us plot the graph with the (numerical) Centrality measuring
colouring the Nodes:

```{r Plot-Using-Centrality}
# setting theme_graph 
set_graph_style()

ga_centrality %>% # Start with onr new Network Object
  
  # Now to continue with plotting
  ggraph(layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = betweenness)) +
  
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, 
                      colour = degree)) + 
  
  # discrete colour legend
  scale_color_gradient(guide = "legend",
                       low = "blue", 
                       high = "red") +
  
  scale_edge_alpha(range = c(0.06, 1))

```

## Analyse and visualize network communities

Who is close to whom? Which are the groups you can see?

```{r Calculate-Community}

# visualize communities of nodes
# Add a column, a Categorical Column to show 
# Community Membership
# 
ga_community <- ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(group_louvain())) 

ga_community %>% activate(nodes) %>% as_tibble()

```

Now let us plot the Communities, and colour the nodes based on which
Community they belong with:

```{r Plot-Community}

# setting theme_graph 
set_graph_style()


ga_community %>% 
  ggraph(layout = "graphopt") + 
  geom_edge_link() + 
  geom_node_point(aes(color = community), 
                  size = 5) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name),
                   repel = TRUE, 
                   size = 2,
                   nudge_x = 3, nudge_y = 3) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Accent")

```

## Interactive Graphs with `visNetwork`

Exploring the `VisNetwork` package. Make graphs wiggle and shake using
`tidy` commands! The package implements interactivity using the physical
metaphor of weights and springs we discussed earlier.

The `visNetwork()` function uses a nodes list and edges list to create
an interactive graph. The nodes list **must** include an `"id"` column,
and the edge list **must** have `"from"` and `"to"` columns. The
function also plots the labels for the nodes, using the names of the
cities from the `"label"` column in the node list.

```{r greys-anatomy-data-for-visnetwork}
library(visNetwork)

# Prepare the data for plotting by visNetwork
grey_nodes
grey_edges

```

Let us relabel greys anatomy nodes and edges for use with VisNetwork:

```{r}
grey_nodes_vis <- grey_nodes %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  rename("label" = name) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == "F" ~ "Female",
                         sex == "M" ~ "Male")) %>% 
  replace_na(., list(sex = "Transgender?")) %>% 
  rename("group" = sex)
grey_nodes_vis

```

And now for the edges:

```{r}
grey_edges_vis <- grey_edges %>% 
  select(from, to) %>% 
  left_join(., grey_nodes_vis, 
            by = c("from" = "label")) %>% 
  left_join(., grey_nodes_vis, 
            by = c("to" = "label")) %>%
  select("from"= id.x, "to" = id.y)
grey_edges_vis

```

We will be using [fontawesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/icons)
to plot the Nodes in this graph!!

```{r greys-anatomy-visNetwork}
grey_nodes_vis %>%

  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = grey_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 40)) %>% 
  
  # Colour and icons for each of the gender-groups
  visGroups(groupname = "Female", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "tomato"),
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Male", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f183", size = 75, color = "slateblue"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Transgender?", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f22c", size = 75, color = "fuchsia"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  #visLegend() %>%
  #Add the fontawesome icons!!
  addFontAwesome() %>% 
  
  # Add Interaction Controls
  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE,
                 hover = TRUE,
                 selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 zoomView = TRUE)
```

There is another family of icons available in visNetwork, called
[`ionicons`](https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.5.2/dist/cheatsheet.html).
Let's see how they look:

```{r using-ionicons}
grey_nodes_vis %>%

  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = grey_edges_vis,) %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 12345) %>%
  visNodes(font = list(size = 50)) %>%
  visEdges(color = "green") %>%
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Female",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f25d",
      color = "fuchsia",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Male",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f202",
      color = "green",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Transgender?",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f233",
      color = "dodgerblue",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  addIonicons() %>%
  visInteraction(
    navigationButtons = TRUE,
    hover = TRUE,
    selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
    hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
    zoomView = TRUE
  )
```

Some idea of interactivity and controls with `visNetwork`:

```{r visNetwork-starwars-1, include=FALSE}
library(visNetwork)
# let's look again at the data
starwars_nodes <- read_csv("./Data/star-wars-network-nodes.csv")
starwars_edges <- read_csv("./Data/star-wars-network-edges.csv")

```

Download this `StarWars` datasets and store them in your `/data` folder.
Again, note these are *semicolon separated values* files are before:

```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars_nodes %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "star-wars-network-nodes",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download Nodes data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
starwars_edges %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "star-wars-network-edges",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download Edges data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
```

```{r visNetwork-starwars-2, eval=FALSE}
library(visNetwork)
# let's look again at the data
starwars_nodes <- read_delim("./Data/star-wars-network-nodes.csv",
                             delim = ";")

starwars_edges <- read_delim("./Data/star-wars-network-edges.csv",
                             delim = ";")

starwars_edges
starwars_nodes

```

```{r visNetwork-starwars-3}
# We need to rename starwars nodes dataframe and edge dataframe columns for visNetwork
starwars_nodes_vis <- 
  starwars_nodes %>% 
  rename("label" = name)

# Convert from and to columns to **node ids**
starwars_edges_vis <- 
  starwars_edges %>% 
  
  # Matching Source <- Source Node id ("id.x")
  left_join(., starwars_nodes_vis, by = c("source" = "label")) %>% 
  
  # Matching Target <- Target Node id ("id.y")
  left_join(., starwars_nodes_vis, by = c("target" = "label")) %>% 
  
# Select "id.x" and "id.y" ONLY
# Rename them as "from" and "to"
# keep "weight" column for aesthetics of edges
  select("from" = id.x, "to" = id.y, "value" = weight)

# Check everything once
starwars_nodes_vis
starwars_edges_vis

```

Ok, let's make things move and shake!!

```{r visNetwork-starwars-futbol}
visNetwork(nodes = starwars_nodes_vis,
           edges = starwars_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 30), shape = "icon", 
           icon = list(code = "f1e3", size = 75)) %>% 
  addFontAwesome() %>% 
  visEdges(color = "red")

```

```{r visNetwork-starwars}
visNetwork(nodes = starwars_nodes_vis,
           edges = starwars_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 30)) %>% 
  visEdges(color = "red")
```

# Your Assignments:

## Make-1 : With a ready made dataset

Step 1. Fire up a new R Project and a new RMarkdown within. Write your name, file_name and date.

Step 2. Take **any one** of the Datasets datasets described below.

Step 3. RMarkdown contents:

-   Introduce / Inspect in R your data and describe
-   Introduce your Purpose
-   Create graph objects.
-   Write comments in the code
-   Write narrative in text with sections, bold ,italic etc.

Step 4. Knit before you submit. Submit your *entire* Project as a .zip file.

## Datasets:

a)  Airline Data:

```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
    airline_nodes <- read_csv("./Data/AIRLINES-NODES.csv") %>%
      mutate(Id = Id + 1)
    airline_edges <- read_csv("./Data/AIRLINES-EDGES.csv") %>%
      mutate(Source = Source + 1, Target = Target + 1)
    ```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
airline_nodes %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "AIRLINES-NODES",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )

airline_edges %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "AIRLINES-EDGES",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
```

 - As before check that you use `read_delim()` rather than
    `read_csv()`, as needed.

b)  The Famous Zachary Karate Club dataset
 - Start with pulling this data into your Rmarkdown:

<!-- -->

    data("karate",package= "igraphdata")
    karate

 - Try `?karate` in the console
 - Note that this is **not** a set of nodes, nor edges, **but** already a **graph-object**!
 - So no need to create a graph object using `tbl_graph`.
 - You will need to just go ahead and plot using `ggraph`.

## Make-2: Literary Network with TV Show / Book / Story / Play

This is in groups. Groups of 4. To be announced

You need to create a Network Graph for your favourite **Book, play, TV serial or Show**. (E.g. Brooklyn99, Friends, BBT, or LB or HIMYM...or Hamlet, Little Women , Pride and Prejudice, or LoTR)

Step 0. Fire up a new RProject, and a new Rmd file within.

Step 1. Go to: [Literary
Networks](https://www.teachengineering.org/activities/view/uno_graphtheory_lesson01_activity2) for instructions. **Make your data** using the instructions.

  - In the nodes excel, use id and names as your columns. Any other
    details in other columns to the right.
  - In your edges Excel file, use from and to are your first columns. Entries in these columns can be names or ids but be consistent and
    don't mix.
  - ENSURE SPELLINGS ARE CONSISTENT FOR THE NAMES

Step 3. Decide on 3 answers that you to seek and plan to make graphs
for.

Step 4. Create graph objects. Say 3 visualizations.

Step 5. Write comments/answers in the code and narrative text. Add pictures from the web using Markdown syntax.

Step 6. Write Reflection (OK, a short one!) *inside* your RMarkdown. Make sure it knits!!

Step 7. Group Submission: Submit the entire Project as a zip file. Each person submits on their Assignments. All get the same grade on this one.

Ask me for clarifications on what to do *after* you have read the Instructions in your group.
