# Introduction

This RMarkdown document is part of the Generic Skills Component (GSK) of
the Course of the Foundation Studies Programme at Srishti Manipal
Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, Bangalore India. The material
is based on *A Layered Grammar of Graphics* by Hadley Wickham. The
course is meant for First Year students pursuing a Degree in Art and
Design.

The intent of this GSK part is to build Skill in coding in R, and also
appreciate R as a way to metaphorically visualize information of various
kinds, using predominantly geometric figures and structures.

All RMarkdown files combine code, text, web-images, and figures
developed using code. Everything is text; code chunks are enclosed in
**fences** (\`\`\`)

# Goals

At the end of this Lab session, we should:

\- know the types and structures of `network data` and be able to work
with them

\- understand the basics of modern network packages in R

\- be able to create network visualizations using `tidygraph`, `ggraph`(
static visualizations ) and `visNetwork` (interactive visualizations)

\- see directions for how the network metaphor applies in a variety of
domains (e.g. biology/ecology, ideas/influence, technology,
transportation, to name a few)

# Pedagogical Note

The method followed will be based on
[PRIMM](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/cser/2017/09/01/primm-a-structured-approach-to-teaching-programming/):

-   **PREDICT** Inspect the code and guess at what the code might do,
    **write predictions**
-   **RUN** the code provided and check what happens
-   **INFER** what the `parameters` of the code do and **write comments
    to explain**. What bells and whistles can you see?
-   **MODIFY** the `parameters` code provided to understand the
    `options` available. **Write comments** to show what you have aimed
    for and achieved.
-   **MAKE** : take an idea/concept of your own, and graph it.

# Set Up

The `setup` code **chunk** below brings into our coding session **R
packages** that provide specific computational abilities and also
**datasets** which we can use.

To reiterate: Packages and datasets are **not** the same thing !!
Packages are (small) collections of programs. Datasets are
just....information.

# Graph Metaphors

Network graphs are characterized by two key terms: **nodes** and
**edges**

1.  `Nodes` : **Entities**

    -   Metaphors: Individual People? Things? Ideas? Places? to be
        connected in the network.
    -   Synonyms: `vertices`. Nodes have `IDs`.

2.  `Edges`: **Connections**

    -   Metaphors: Interactions? Relationships? Influence? Letters sent
        and received? Dependence? between the entities.
    -   Synonyms: `links`, `ties`.

In R, we create network representations using node and edge information.
*One way* in which these could be organized are:

\- `Node list`: a data frame with a single column listing the node IDs
found in the edge list. You can also add **attribute columns** to the
data frame such as the names of the nodes or grouping variables. ( Type?
Class? Family? Country? Subject? Race? )

+----+----------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ID | Node Name      | Attribute? Qualities?Categories? Family?       |
|    |                | Country?Planet?                                |
+----+----------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 1  | Ned            | Nursery School Teacher                         |
+----+----------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 2  | Jaguar Paw     | Main Character, Apocalypto                     |
+----+----------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 3  | John Snow      | Epidemiologist                                 |
+----+----------------+------------------------------------------------+

: Node Table

-   `Edge list`: data frame containing two columns: **source node** and
    **destination node** of an `edge`. Source and Destination have
    `node IDs`.
-   `Weighted network graph`: An edge list can also contain additional
    columns describing attributes of the edges such as a magnitude
    aspect for an edge. If the edges have a magnitude attribute the
    graph is considered weighted.

+-------+-------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| From  | To    | Relationship             | Weightage                |
+=======+=======+==========================+==========================+
| 1     | 3     | Financial Dealings       | 6                        |
+-------+-------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| 2     | 1     | History Lessons          | 2                        |
+-------+-------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| 2     | 3     | Vaccination              | 15                       |
+-------+-------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

: Edges Table

-   `Layout`: A **geometric** arrangement of `nodes` and `edges`.

    -   Metaphors: Location? Spacing? Distance? Coordinates? Colour?
        Shape? Size? Provides visual insight due to the `arrangement`.\

-   `Layout Algorithms` : `Method` to arranges `nodes` and `edges` with
    the aim of optimizing some `metric` .

    -   Metaphors: Nodes are `masses` and edges are `springs`. The
        Layout algorithm minimizes the stretching and compressing of all
        springs.(BTW, are the Spring Constants K the same for all
        springs?...)

8.  `Directed and undirected network graph`: If the distinction between
    source and target is meaningful, the network is **directed.** If the
    distinction is not meaningful, the network is **undirected**.
    **Directed edges** represent an ordering of nodes, like a
    relationship extending from one node to another, where switching the
    direction would change the structure of the network. **Undirected
    edges** are simply links between nodes where order does not matter.

Examples:

-   The World Wide Web is an example of a directed network because
    hyperlinks connect one Web page to another, but not necessarily the
    other way around.

-   Co-authorship networks represent examples of un-directed networks,
    where nodes are authors and they are connected by an edge if they
    have written a publication together

-   When people send e-mail to each other, the distinction between the
    sender (source) and the recipient (target) is clearly meaningful,
    therefore the network is directed.

9.  `Connected` and `Disconnected` graphs: If there is *some* path from
    *any node* to *any other node*, the Networks is said to be
    Connected. Else, Disconnected.

## Using `tidygraph` and `ggraph`

`tidygraph` and `ggraph` are modern R packages for network data. Graph
Data setup and manipulation is done in tidygraph and graph visualization
with ggraph.

-   `tidygraph` Data -\> "Network Object" in R.
-   `ggraph` Network Object -\> Plots using a chosen layout/algo.

Both leverage the power of **`igraph`**, which is the **Big Daddy** of
all network packages. We will be using the Grey's Anatomy dataset in our
first foray into networks.

## Step1. Read the data

```{r 1.Read-greys-anatomy-data, message=FALSE}

grey_nodes <- read_csv("data/grey_nodes.csv")
grey_edges <- read_csv("data/grey_edges.csv")


# grey_nodes <- read_delim("./Data/greys-nodes.csv", delim = ";")
# ger_edges <- read_delim("~/Downloads/grey-edges.csv", 
#     delim = ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
grey_nodes
grey_edges
```

```{r, for_teaching_only, echo=FALSE}
grey_nodes %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "greys-nodes",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download Grey Nodes as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )

grey_edges %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "greys-edges",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download Grey Edges data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
```

::: {.panel .panel-success}
::: {.panel-heading}
Questions and Inferences \#1:
:::

::: {.panel-body}
Look at the console output thumbnail. What does for example
`name = col_character` mean? What attributes (i.e. extra information)
are seen for Nodes and Edges? Understand the data in both nodes and
edges as shown in the second and third thumbnails. Write some comments
and inferences here.
:::
:::

## Step 2.Create a network object using tidygraph:

Key function:

-   `tbl_graph()`: (aka "tibble graph"). Key arguments: `nodes`, `edges`
    and `directed`. Note this is a very versatile command and can take
    many input forms, such as data structures that result from other
    packages. Type `?tbl_graph` in the Console and see the `Usage`
    section.

```{r 2.Create-greys-anatomy-graph-object}
ga <- tbl_graph(nodes = grey_nodes, 
                edges = grey_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
ga
```

::: {.panel .panel-success}
::: {.panel-heading}
Questions and Inferences \#2:
:::

::: {.panel-body}
**Questions and Inferences**: What information does the graph object
contain? What attributes do the nodes have? What about the edges?
:::
:::

## Step 3. Plot using `ggraph`

3a. Quick Plot: `autograph()` This is to check quickly is the data is
imported properly and to decide upon going on to a more elaborate
plotting.

```{r 3a.Auto-graph-greys-anatomy}
autograph(ga)

```

::: {.panel-heading}
Questions and Inferences \#3:
:::

::: {.panel-body}
**Questions and Inferences**: Describe this graph, in simple words here.
Try to use some of the new domain words we have just acquired:
nodes/edges, connected/disconnected, directed/undirected.
:::
:::

3b. More elaborate plot

Key functions:

-   `ggraph(layout = "......")`: Create classic node-edge diagrams; i.e.
    Sets up the graph. Rather like `ggplot` for networks!

Two kinds of `geom`: one set for nodes, and another for edges

-   `geom_node_point(aes(.....))`: Draws node as "points". Alternatives
    are `circle / arc_bar / tile / voronoi`. Remember the `geom`s that
    we have seen before in Grammar of Graphics!

-   `geom_edge_link(aes(.....))`: Draws edges as "links". Alternatives
    are
    `arc / bend / elbow / hive / loop / parallel / diagonal / point / span /tile`.

-   `geom_node_text(aes(label = ......), repel = TRUE)`: Adds text
    labels (non-overlapping). Alternatives are `label /...`

-   `labs(title = "....", subtitle = "....", caption = "....")`: Change
    main titles, axis labels and legend titles. We know this from our
    work with `ggplot`.

```{r 3b.Ggraph-greys-anatomy}

# Write Comments next to each line 
# About what that line does for the overall graph

ggraph(graph = ga,  layout = "kk") +
  #
  
  geom_edge_link(width = 2, color = "pink") +
  #
  
  geom_node_point(
    shape = 21,
    size = 8,
    fill = "blue",
    color = "green",
    stroke = 2
  ) +
  #
  
  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My first silly Grey's Anatomy graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did Ramesh put me in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are doing **cool** things in the other
       classes...")

```

::: {.panel .panel-success}

Questions and Inferences \#3:
:::

::: {.panel-body}
**Questions and Inferences**: What parameters have been changed here,
compared to the earlier graph? Where do you see these changes in the
code above?
:::
:::

Let us **Play** with this graph and see if we can make some small
changes. Colour? Fill? Width? Size? Stroke? Labs? Of course!

```{r 3c.Modify-Greys-Anatomy-ggraph}
# Change the parameters in each of the commands here to new ones
# Use fixed values for colours or sizes...etc. 

ggraph(graph = ga,  layout = "kk") + 
  geom_edge_link(width = 2) + 
  geom_node_point(shape = 21, size = 8, 
                  fill = "blue", 
                  color = "green", 
                  stroke = 2) +
  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My next silly Grey's Anatomy graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did Ramesh put me in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are doing cool things in the other 
       classes...")
```

:::

::: {.panel-body}
**Questions and Inferences**: What did the `shape` parameter achieve?
What are the possibilities with `shape`? How about including `alpha`?
:::
:::

3c. Aesthetic Mapping from Node and Edge attribute columns

Up to now, we have **assigned** *specific numbers* to geometric
aesthetics such as shape and size. Now we are ready ( maybe ?) change
the meaning and significance of the entire graph and each element within
it, and use **aesthetics / metaphoric mappings** to achieve new meanings
or insights. Let us try using `aes()` inside each `geom` to map a
`variable` to a geometric aspect.

Don't try to use more than 2 aesthetic mappings simultaneously!!

The node elements we can tweak are:

-   Types of Nodes: `geom_node_****()`\
-   Node Parameters: inside `geom_node_****(aes(...............))`\
    -`aes(alpha  = node-variable)` : opacity; a value between 0 and 1\
    -`aes(shape  = node-variable)` : node shape\
    -`aes(colour = node-variable)` : node colour\
    -`aes(fill   = node-variable)` : fill colour for node\
    -`aes(size   = node-variable)` : size of node

The edge elements we can tweak are:

-   Type of Edges" `geom_edge_****()`\
-   Edge Parameters: inside `geom_edge_****(aes(...............))`\
    -`aes(colour = edge-variable)` : colour of the edge\
    -`aes(width  = edge-variable)` : width of the edge\
    -`aes(label  = some_variable)` : labels for the edge

Type `?geom_node_point` and `?geom-edge_link` in your Console for more
information.

```{r 3d.aesthetics-using-ggraph-Modify}

ggraph(graph = ga, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight)) + # add mapping here
  
  geom_node_point(aes(color = race), size = 6) + # add mapping here

  # geom_node_label(aes(label = name), # modify this mapping
  #                 repel = TRUE, max.overlaps = 20,
  #                 alpha = 0.6,
  #                 size = 3) +

  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! Yet another Grey's Anatomy graph in R!")

# Network analysis with tidygraph

The data frame graph representation can be easily augmented with
**metrics** or **statistics** computed on the graph. Remember how we
computed `counts` with the penguin dataset in Grammar of Graphics.

Before computing a metric on nodes or edges use the `activate()`
function to activate either node or edge data frames. Use `dplyr`
**verbs** (`filter, arrange, mutate`) to achieve your computation in the
proper way.

## Network Centrality

Centrality is a an "ill-defined" metric of **node and edge importance**
in a network. It is therefore calculated in many ways. Type
`?centrality` in your Console.

![Standards](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

Let's add a few columns to the nodes and edges based on network
centrality measures:

```{r network-analysis-1}
ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  
  # Most connections?
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = c("in"))) %>% 
  filter(degree > 0) %>% 
  
  activate(edges) %>% 
  # "Busiest" edge?
  mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness())

```

Packages `tidygraph` and `ggraph` can be pipelined to perform analysis
and visualization tasks in one go.

```{r Using-Centrality}
# setting theme_graph 
set_graph_style()

ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  
  # Who has the most connections?
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  
  activate(edges) %>% 
  # Who is the go-through person?
  mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>%
  
  # Now to continue with plotting
  ggraph(layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = betweenness)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, colour = degree)) + 
  
  # discrete colour legend
  scale_color_gradient(guide = "legend")

# or even less typing
  ggraph(ga,layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = centrality_edge_betweenness())) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = centrality_degree(), 
                      size = centrality_degree())) + 
  scale_color_gradient(guide = "legend",
                       low = "green",
                       high = "red")

# Interactive Graphs with `visNetwork`

Exploring the `VisNetwork` package. Make graphs wiggle and shake using
`tidy` commands! The package implements interactivity using the physical
metaphor of weights and springs we discussed earlier.

The `visNetwork()` function uses a nodes list and edges list to create
an interactive graph. The nodes list must include an "id" column, and
the edge list must have "from" and "to" columns. The function also plots
the labels for the nodes, using the names of the cities from the "label"
column in the node list.

```{r greys-anatomy-data-for-visnetwork}
library(visNetwork)

# Prepare the data for plotting by visNetwork
grey_nodes
grey_edges

# Relabel greys anatomy nodes and edges for VisNetwork
grey_nodes_vis <- grey_nodes %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  rename("label" = name) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == "F" ~ "Female",
                         sex == "M" ~ "Male")) %>% 
  replace_na(., list(sex = "Transgender?")) %>% 
  rename("group" = sex)
grey_nodes_vis
grey_edges_vis <- grey_edges %>% 
  select(from, to) %>% 
  left_join(., grey_nodes_vis, 
            by = c("from" = "label")) %>% 
  left_join(., grey_nodes_vis, 
            by = c("to" = "label")) %>%
  select("from"= id.x, "to" = id.y)
grey_edges_vis
```

  visGroups(groupname = "Female", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "tomato"),
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Male", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f183", size = 75, color = "slateblue"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Transgender?", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f22c", size = 75, color = "fuchsia"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  #visLegend() %>%
  #Add the fontawesome icons!!
  addFontAwesome() %>% 
  
  # Add Interaction Controls
  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE,
                 hover = TRUE,
                 selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 zoomView = TRUE)
```

There is another family of icons available in visNetwork, called
[`ionicons`](https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.5.2/dist/cheatsheet.html).
Let's see how they look:

```{r using-ionicons}
grey_nodes_vis %>%

  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = grey_edges_vis,) %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 12345) %>%
  visNodes(font = list(size = 50)) %>%
  visEdges(color = "green") %>%
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Female",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f25d",
      color = "fuchsia",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Male",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f202",
      color = "green",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Transgender?",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f233",
      color = "dodgerblue",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  addIonicons() %>%
  visInteraction(
    navigationButtons = TRUE,
    hover = TRUE,
    selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
    hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
    zoomView = TRUE
  )
```

Some idea of interactivity and controls with `visNetwork`:

```{r visNetwork-starwars-1}
library(visNetwork)
# let's look again at the data
starwars_nodes <- read_csv("./Data/star-wars-network-nodes.csv")
starwars_edges <- read_csv("./Data/star-wars-network-edges.csv")

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars_nodes %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "star-wars-network-nodes",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download Nodes data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
starwars_edges %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "star-wars-network-edges",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download Edges data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
```

```{r visNetwork-starwars-2}
# We need to rename starwars nodes dataframe and edge dataframe columns for visNetwork
starwars_nodes_vis <- 
  starwars_nodes %>% 
  rename("label" = name)

# Convert from and to columns to **node ids**
starwars_edges_vis <- 
  starwars_edges %>% 
  
  # Matching Source <- Source Node id ("id.x")
  left_join(., starwars_nodes_vis, by = c("source" = "label")) %>% 
  
  # Matching Target <- Target Node id ("id.y")
  left_join(., starwars_nodes_vis, by = c("target" = "label")) %>% 
  
# Select "id.x" and "id.y" ONLY
# Rename them as "from" and "to"
# keep "weight" column for aesthetics of edges
  select("from" = id.x, "to" = id.y, "value" = weight)

# Check everything once
starwars_nodes_vis
starwars_edges_vis
```

Ok, let's make things move and shake!!

```{r visNetwork-starwars-futbol}
visNetwork(nodes = starwars_nodes_vis,
           edges = starwars_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 30), shape = "icon", 
           icon = list(code = "f1e3", size = 75)) %>% 
  addFontAwesome() %>% 
  visEdges(color = "red")
```

```{r visNetwork-starwars}
visNetwork(nodes = starwars_nodes_vis,
           edges = starwars_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 30)) %>% 
  visEdges(color = "red")
```

# Your Assignments:

## Make-1 : With a ready made dataset

Step 1. Fire up a *new* RMarkdown. Write your name, file_name and date.

Step 2. Take **any one** of the "Make1-Datasets" datasets decribed
below.

Step 3. RMarkdown contents:

-   Introduce / Inspect in R your data and describe
-   Introduce your Purpose
-   Create graph objects.
-   Write comments in the code
-   Write narrative in text with sections, bold ,italic etc.

Step 4. Knit before you submit. Submit only your knittable `.Rmd` file.

## Make1 - Datasets:

a)  Airline Data:

-   Start with this bit of code in your second chunk, after `set up`

```{r, message=FALSE}
airline_nodes <- read_csv("./Data/AIRLINES-NODES.csv") %>% mutate(Id = Id + 1)
airline_edges <- read_csv("./Data/AIRLINES-EDGES.csv") %>%
mutate(Source = Source + 1, Target = Target + 1)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
airline_nodes %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "AIRLINES-NODES",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )

airline_edges %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "AIRLINES-EDGES",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download data as csv",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
```

b)  The Famous Zachary Karate Club dataset

-   Start with pulling this data into your Rmarkdown:

<!-- -->

    data("karate",package= "igraphdata")
    karate

-   Try `?karate` in the console
-   Note that this is **not** a set of nodes, nor edges, **but** already
    a **graph-object**!
-   So no need to create a graph object using `tbl_graph`.
-   You will need to just go ahead and plot using `ggraph`.

c)  Game of Thrones:

-   Start with pulling this data into your Rmarkdown:

```{r}

GoT <- read_rds("./data/GoT.RDS")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
GoT %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "GoT",
    output_extension = ".rds",
    button_label = "Download data as RDS",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save",
    class = "hvr-sweep-to-left"
  )
```

-   Note that this is a **list** of **7** graphs from Game of Thrones.
-   Select one using `GoT[[index]]` where index = 1...7 and then plot
    directly.
-   Try to access the nodes and edges and modify them using any
    attribute data

3.  Any other graph dataset from `igraphdata` (type `?igraphdata` in
    console)

-   Ask me for help if you need any

## Make-2: Literary Network with TV Show / Book / Story / Play

This is in groups. Groups of 4. To be announced

You need to create a Network Graph for your favourite **Book, play, TV
serial or Show**. (E.g. Friends, BBT, or LB or HIMYM...or Hamlet, Little
Women , Pride and Prejudice, or LoTR)

Step 1. Go to: [Literary
Networks](https://www.teachengineering.org/activities/view/uno_graphtheory_lesson01_activity2)
for instructions. (Instructions are on also Teams -\> Files.)

Step 2. **Make your data** using the instructions.

-   In the nodes excel, use `id` and `names` as your columns. Any other
    details in other columns to the right.

-   In your `edges` excel, use `from` and `to` are your first columns.
    Entries in these columns can be `names` or `id`s but be consistent
    and don't mix.

Step 3. Decide on 3 answers that you to seek and plan to make graphs
for.

Step 4. Create graph objects. Say 3 visualizations.

Step 5. Write comments/answers in the code and narrative text. Add
pictures from the web using Markdown syntax.

Step 6. Write Reflection ( ok, a short one!) *inside* your RMarkdown.
Make sure it knits!!

Step 7. Group Submission: Submit the knittable *.Rmd file* **AND** the
data. RMarkdown with joint authorship. Each person submits on their
Assignments. All get the same grade on this one.

Ask me for clarifications on what to do *after* you have read the
Instructions in your group.
