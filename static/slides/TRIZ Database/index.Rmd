## TRIZ: A Workflow Review

 - Formulate a **CONTRADICTION** (a trade-off or a compromise)
 
 - Specify an **IDEAL FINAL RESULT**
 
 - Convert/metaphorize the **CONTRADICTION** into **TRIZ PARAMETER**s
 
 - Look up the **CONTRADICTION MATRIX**
 
 - Discover the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** you might apply
 
 - *Un-metaphorize* the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** to apply them in a specific way in your problem and solve it

## TRIZ Workflow: Example #1
### Meat Transportation

.pull-left[
A meat plant in South America ships its product to the United States. Refrigeration is required during

transport to keep the meat frozen. The meat is flown to the United States, so refrigeration systems were installed in cargo planes. When competition increased, the owner of the plant sought to reduce delivery cost. It became obvious that he must increase the amount of product per air shipment. Analysis of the situation revealed that he could compete better if the weight of the refrigeration system were replaced with that of meat. He did exactly that. Flying at an altitude of 15,000–25,000 feet the air temperature is below 32oF, so no refrigeration system was actually needed.

Conclusion: Utilization of existing resources costing nothing brought the system closer to Ideality. The art of inventing is the ability to remove barriers to Ideality in order to qualitatively improve a technical system. (In this book we are talking only about technical systems; however, this statement can be applied to any system.)

## TRIZ Workflow: Example #2
### Arc of the Diver
.pull_left[For high water diving, water must be “hard” to support the diver and “soft” so as not to injure the diver. The physical contradiction: The water must be hard and soft at the same time. This contradiction is resolved by separating the requirements in space: Saturate the water with air bubbles — the pool contains both air and water.]
