## TRIZ: A Quick Workflow

 - Formulate a **CONTRADICTION** (a trade-off or a compromise)
 
 - Specify an **IDEAL FINAL RESULT**
 
 - Convert/metaphorize the **CONTRADICTION** into **TRIZ PARAMETER**s
 
 - Look up the **CONTRADICTION MATRIX**
 
 - Discover the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** you might apply
 
 - *Un-metaphorize* the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** to apply them in a specific way in your problem and solve it
 
 Now let us look at these steps in pictorial detail ðŸ–¼

## TRIZ Workflow: Formulate a Contradiction
.pull-left[
- Use your [**CULTURAL CAPITAL**](https://culturallearningalliance.org.uk/what-is-cultural-capital/) and your **DOMAINs** to write a PROBLEM in simple English
- Ask:
    - **5W+H**
          - **What** does the problem seem to be?
          - **Who** has the problem?  
          - **When** does the problem occur? All the time? Under certain circumstances? 
          - **Where** does the problem occur? 
          - **Why** does the problem occur? "Ask why 5 times" -- W. Edwards Deming 
          - **How** does the problem occur?

# TRIZ Workflow: Look the "Resources"

.pull-left[
Before we further clarify our **CONTRADICTION**, what Resources do we have?
- One Good way to do this is using the **Ishikawa Diagram**

  - Man, Material, Method, Management, Machinery (Ishikawa)
  - This diagram is used **primarily** to assign **CAUSES**
  - But it conveniently lists all the **Resources**
  - We should understand that word, **Resources** in its most startling "TRIZ" sense !!
  - We can use this diagram to develop our **CONTRADICTIONS** more clearly
  - What things create the compromise/tradeoff?

- **But: the Milk will boil over...**

- **TC**: 
    - I can either boil Milk, OR do something else, NOT both.

- Use the Ishikawa Diagram:
    - Man: Me?
    - Method : 
      - Operating the Stove
      - Wanting/Doing Two Things at the Same Time
    - Material: Milk, Vessel, Stove, Gas, Time, Heat
        - Milk boils over when it is heated

## TRIZ Workflow: Specify the Ideal Final Result (IFR)

.pull-left[
- State an **Ideal Final Result**

- A basic principle of TRIZ is that systems evolve towards increased **ideality**, where ideality is defined as

$$Ideality = (Benefits - Harm) / Costs$$
- **Evolution** is in the direction of

 - â¬† Increasing benefits
 - â¬‡ Decreasing costs
 - â¬‡ Decreasing harm

]

.pull-right[

The ***extreme result*** of this evolution is the Ideal Final Result:
 - It has all the benefits,  
 
 - none of the harm, and
 
 - none of the costs of the original problem.
 
 - The Ideal Final Result describes the solution to a technical problem, **independent of the mechanism or constraints of the original problem**. 
 - It occupies no space, has no weight, requires no labour, requires no maintenance. 
 
]

**IFR: The Milk must "boil itself" and wait for me.**
Any other way of saying this?

## TRIZ Workflow: Use the Contradiction Matrix
.pull-left[
![](https://darrellmann.com/wp-content/uploads/boiling-pan-mini-case.png)
]
.pull-right[
- TRIZ offers 39 Metaphors to symbolize CONTRADICTIONs
- PAIRS of these parameters metaphorically represent our CONTRADICTION
  - One Worsening Parameter: **17: Energy Usage by Stationary Object** (Stove is ON !!)
  - One Parameter to Improve: **21: Stability** ( Milk must NOT boil over !!)
  
- **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** from the Matrix: 
    - 35: Parameter Change, 
    - 18: Mechanical Vibration, 
    - 24: Intermediary, 
    - 9: Prior Counteraction, 
    - 3: The Other Way Around

Also we can use two vessels, one inside the other. The inner one with milk and the other one with water!

**A Milk Watcher Device**
- This is dropped into the vessel before pouring the milk
- It vibrates when the milk is boiling and prevents spillage
- And of course, there is a patent. Yes , in Russia, where else !!

## TRIZ Workflow: IP-35: Parameter Change
.pull-left[

- What "Parameter" can we change?  
    - Temperature?
    
    - Rate of Gas?
    
    - Kind of metal used in Vessel?
    
    - Smoothness of the Vessel finish?
]

.pull-right[
Here are some solutions using Parameter Change
- Sprinkle Water on the Froth...Umm

- **Apply butter to the rim of the vessel beforehand !!**
- This is also a solution derivable from **IP-9: Prior Counter Action**

## TRIZ Workflow: IP - 13: The Other Way Around
What do you think?

- Cold Milk poured into an already hot vessel? Wild...

- How about the Two Vessel Trick, from earlier: one inside the other. The inner one with milk and the other one with water! Can the Water be hot before hand?

- Not all IPs may strike you as applicable! 

- Try and leverage somebody's else's **Cultural Capital** !!

## TRIZ Workflow: Example #2: Problem Statement
.pull-left[
**PROBLEM**: 
- ** Maintaining the Lawn**

Consider the **power lawnmower** as a tool and the lawn as the object to be cut. 
- The lawnmower is noisy, 
- uses fuel, `r emoji("fuelpump")`
- requires human time `r emoji("hourglass")` and energy, `r emoji("muscle")`
- produces air pollution, `r emoji("cloud")`
- throws out debris that can endanger children or pets (or the legs of the person pushing it), 
- and is difficult to maintain.ðŸ§°

.pull-right[
.pull-left[

![Lawn!!](https://images.pexels.com/photos/280222/pexels-photo-280222.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500)]

If our job is "improve the lawnmower" instead, we could immediately set up and prioritize solutions for a number of TRIZ problems to improve fuel usage, reduce noise, improve safety, etc.   
***But, if we define the Ideal Final Result***, we can get a much better perspective on the future of the lawnmower, and the lawn care industry.
