## A Famous Lady and her Famous Experiment

.small[In 1853, Turkey declared war on Russia. After the Russian Navy destroyed a Turkish squadron in the Black Sea, Great Britain and France joined with Turkey. In September of the following year, the British landed on the Crimean Peninsula and set out, with the French and Turks, to take the Russian naval base at Sevastopol.

What followed was a tragicomedy of errors -- failure of supply, failed communications, international rivalries. Conditions in the armies were terrible, and disease ate through their ranks. They finally did take Sevastopol a year later, after a ghastly assault. It was ugly business all around. Well over half a million soldiers lost their lives during the Crimean War.]

### Using Interrogative Pronouns
- Nominal: **What? Who? Where?** (Just names)

- Ordinal: **Which Types? What Sizes? How Big?** (Factors, Dimensions)

- Interval: **How Often?** (Numbers, *Facts*)

- Ratio: **How many? How much? How heavy?** (Numbers, *Facts*)

## Nightingale's Rose

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height="450px", out.width="450px"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/rose.jpg")
```

???
.small[Nightingale created a remarkable and original graphical display to show us just what hadd really gone on in the War. It was a .orange[Polar-Area Diagram] that showed how people had died during the period from July, 1854, through the end of the following year. 

Nightingale's graph is like a pie chart, cut into twelve equal angles. These slices advance in a clockwise direction, one each month. The radius shows how many deaths occurred in that month. We see little short slices in April, May and June of 1854. After the troops land in the Crimea, the slices begin reaching far outward in the radial direction.

There's more: Each slice has three sections, one for deaths from wounds in battle, one for "other causes", and one for disease.

Once you see Nightingale's graph, the terrible picture is clear. The Russians were a minor enemy. **The real enemies were cholera, typhus, and dysentery**. Once the military looked at that eloquent graph, the modern army hospital system was inevitable.

## Yes, But Why? Shapes and Data Viz Culture

.pull-left[
- Each Data Vis answers a **Question**
- We can digest information more easily when it is pictorial
- Our Working Memories are both short-term and limited in capacity. 
- So a picture abstracts the details and presents us with an overall summary, an insight, or a story that is both easy to recall and easy on retention.
- Data Viz includes shapes that carry strong cultural memories; and impressions for us. 
- These cultural memories help us to use data viz in a universal way to appeal to a wide variety of audiences.

### Visualization: A Metaphor from Data -> Geometry

- How did we arrive at shapes, colours, lines, points...from data?

- All Statistical Graphs do a Kalidasa

- They use metaphors to map .orange[data variables] and .orange[computed stats] to .orange[geometrical aspects] aka .orange[aesthetics]

- They may also compute stuff with data *before* plotting, as we shall see

- Shapes have Cultural Significance

- We may all have a [Gene for Geometry](https://www.xcode.in/genes-and-personality/how-genes-influence-your-math-ability︎)

## What Else Could We have Discussed?
- Coordinates: Cartesian or Polar?
    - A Bar Chart in Polar is... a Pie!!!
- Small Multiples: Making multiple smaller graphs
- Charts for : 
  - Survey Data (Likert Plots)
  - Multiple Qual variables (Mosaic Plots)
  - Ranks (Bump Charts / Dumbbell Charts)
  - Ratings (Radar Plots)
- Scales: Matching Axes to the Units of the variables (percentage, currency..)
- Colour Palettes
- Annotations on Charts

---
## Conclusion
- We question the world and form *Hypotheses* out of surprise
- Hypotheses leads us to define *Questions*
- Questions lead to *Variables* and *Data*
- Questions *with* Variables lead to *Graphs*
- With Graphs, we can write *Stories* that can drive Decisions, Designs, Policies, and...Art!!
