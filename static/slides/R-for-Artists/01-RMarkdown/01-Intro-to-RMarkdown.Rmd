# To ~~err~~ R is human

### Let's talk about what RMarkdown is all about !!


---

# What is RMarkdown?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "1000px", out.height="550px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/main/rstats-artwork/rmarkdown_wizards.png")

```

# What is RMarkdown?
In an RMarkdown document:

- What you type in **text** becomes your *story*

- What you write as `code` makes your own **figures** 
`r emoji("bar_chart")`
    - code is written in ```fences``` with back-ticks

- You can link in:
    - pictures `r emoji("art")`
    - YT videos `r emoji("movie_camera")` from the web

- Data / Code / Figures / Pictures / Document  **together** 

- In a document that **"computes"**

---

# What is RMarkdown?

Click on the File -> RMarkdown

```{r out.height = "400px", out.width= "850px", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here("static", "images", "New-Rmd.png"))

```

# Editing your Markdown

.pull-left[Edit the **YAML** header now. ( The stuff at the top between the three dashes)

- Name your file

- Write your name as author

- Change Date if you wish

SAVE.
]

.pull-right[

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "500px", out.height="450px", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("static", "images", "YAML.png"))

```

]

# Editing your Markdown

- Everything is text
- Wrap Words in stars:
    - ```*italics*```: Single stars give you *italics*
    
    - ```**bold**```: Two stars give you **bold** text
    
    - ```***bold italic***```: Three stars ***bold italics***
    
    - ```~~deleted~~```: Tildes give you ~~deleted~~ text

---

# Editing your Markdown


- Hashes(`##`) become new Section Titles in text

- **Ctrl+Alt+I / CMD+Alt+I** give fenced code "chunks" which will "run". (Green "Play" button)
     - Hashes(`#`) inside code chunks give you new `#comments` in code
     
- "$mathstuff$": becomes $math stuff$ (Nooo...please! No!)

  - "$sin^2(x)+cos^2(x) = 1$":   $sin^2(x)+cos^2(x) = 1$ (I think)
  
- "emoji("laughing")" becomes `r emoji("laughing")`

---

# Editing your Markdown

- All this done with `plain text`. 

- Just your keyboard and you. 

- Mouses and Touchpads are for....**(your favourite word of ridicule here)**.

---

# Knitting your Markdown `r emo::ji("knit")`

Hitting the knit button `r emo::ji("knit")` does one of many things:
.pull-left[
Changes your plain text to:

- html `r emoji("web")`, or PDF `r emoji("file")` or Word `r emoji("document")`

- HTML webpage, or blog, or flexdashboards

- An interactive presentation like this one

- over 30 different output formats.
