## Some Basic Operations/Things in R

- `<-` (variable assignment) ( Alt and - keys together)
- `%>%` (then...) ( aur phir...) (Shift + Ctrl + M / Cmd + Ctrl + M)

- `dplyr`, `ggplot2` (packages)
  - `install.packages("dplyr")` (1x per machine)
  - `library(dplyr)` (1x per work session)

# What is the Tidyverse?

---

The tidyverse is 

- an opinionated collection of R `packages` designed for data science
- All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

---

- Packages are:
    - `readr`: to parse and read in data in various formats
    - `tidyr`: to clean up data, rows and columns
    - `dplyr`: to manipulate data, add new columns, create summaries
    - `ggplot`: Data Visualization

- And a few others...
    - `stringr`: to process character/string data
    - `forcats`: Not about cats `r emo::ji("cat")`, but to deal with factors. We will touch factors, but won't work with forcats. 
    - `purrr`: also not about cats, but about loops and iterations

- No the Cheshire Cat was not involved, but there were others who were found guilty

# What does "tidy data" mean?

# Data for today

We'll use data from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)

- Publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection)
- As analyzed by [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-nerds-guide-to-the-2229-paintings-at-moma/)
- And by [others](https://medium.com/@foe/here-s-a-roundup-of-how-people-have-used-our-data-so-far-80862e4ce220)

---

# Get the data

Use this code chunk to import the cleaned CSV file:

```{r}
library(readr)
moma <- read_csv(here::here("static","slides", "03-tidy", "artworks-cleaned.csv"))

```

# Data wrangling

---


When working with data you must:

* Figure out what you want to do. Be able to state that in English.

* Describe those tasks in the form of a computer program.

* Execute the program.

The `dplyr` package makes these steps fast and easy:

* By constraining your options, it helps you think about your data manipulation challenges.

* It provides simple English **"verbs"**, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate your thoughts into code.

---

`dplyr` aims to provide a function for each basic verb of data manipulation. These verbs can be organised into three categories based on the component of the dataset that they work with:

.pull-left[

* Rows:
  * `filter()` chooses rows based on *column* values.
  * `slice()` chooses rows based on location.
  * `arrange()` changes the order of the rows.
  
]

--

.pull-right[

* Columns:
  * `select()` changes whether or not a column is included.
  * `rename()` changes the name of columns.
  * `mutate()` changes the values of columns and creates new columns.
  * `relocate()` changes the order of the columns.
  * `distinct()` unique values in each column
  * `count` number of occurrences of each unique value in a column
]

Some of you may be able to relate this to MS Excel...


---

* Groups of rows:
  * `summarise()` collapses a group into a single row.

* Whole data.frame/tibble
  * `glimpse()` see what variables are there

## Some Sample Questions!

---

1. How many paintings (rows) are in `moma`? How many variables (columns) are in `moma`?
1. What is the first painting acquired by MoMA? Which year? Which artist? What title?
    - *Hint: you may want to look into `select` + `arrange`*
1. What is the oldest painting in the collection? Which year? Which artist? What title? *(see above hint)*
1. How many distinct artists are there?
1. Which artist has the most paintings in the collection? How many paintings are by this artist?
1. How many paintings are by male vs female artists?

If you want more:
1. How many artists of each gender are there?
1. In what year were the most paintings acquired? Created?
1. In what year was the first painting by a (solo) female artist acquired? When was that painting created? Which artist? What title? 

---

1. How many paintings (rows) are in `moma`? How many variables (columns) are in `moma`?

```{r}
glimpse(moma)

```

---

2. What is the first painting acquired by MoMA? Which year? Which artist? What title?
    - *Hint: you may want to look into `select` + `arrange`*
```{r}
moma %>% 
  select(year_acquired) %>% 
  arrange(year_acquired)

moma %>% 
  select(title,artist,year_acquired) %>% 
  arrange(year_acquired)

```

---

1. What is the oldest painting in the collection? Which year? Which artist? What title? *(see above hint)*

```{r}
moma %>% 
  select(title,artist,year_created) %>% 
  arrange(year_created)

```

---

1. How many distinct artists are there?

```{r}
moma %>% distinct(artist) %>% count()
```

---

1. Which artist has the most paintings in the collection? How many paintings are by this artist?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  summarise(paintings = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(paintings))
```

---

1. How many paintings are by male vs female artists?

```{r}
moma %>% 
  group_by(artist_gender) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())
```


---

1. In what year was the first painting by a (solo) female artist acquired? When was that painting created? Which artist? What title?


```{r}
moma %>% 
  select(title, artist, year_acquired, artist_gender) %>%  arrange(year_acquired, artist_gender)
```
