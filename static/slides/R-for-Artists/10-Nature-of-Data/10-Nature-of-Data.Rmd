## A Famous Lady and her Famous Experiment

.small[In 1853, Turkey declared war on Russia. After the Russian Navy destroyed a Turkish squadron in the Black Sea, Great Britain and France joined with Turkey. In September of the following year, the British landed on the Crimean Peninsula and set out, with the French and Turks, to take the Russian naval base at Sevastopol.

What followed was a tragicomedy of errors -- failure of supply, failed communications, international rivalries. Conditions in the armies were terrible, and disease ate through their ranks. They finally did take Sevastopol a year later, after a ghastly assault. It was ugly business all around. Well over half a million soldiers lost their lives during the Crimean War.]

## Nightingale's Rose
.pull-left[
.small[Nightingale created a remarkable and original graphical display to show us just what hadd really gone on in the War. It was a .orange[Polar-Area Diagram] that showed how people had died during the period from July, 1854, through the end of the following year. 

Nightingale's graph is like a pie chart, cut into twelve equal angles. These slices advance in a clockwise direction, one each month. The radius shows how many deaths occurred in that month. We see little short slices in April, May and June of 1854. After the troops land in the Crimea, the slices begin reaching far outward in the radial direction.

There's more: Each slice has three sections, one for deaths from wounds in battle, one for "other causes", and one for disease.

Once you see Nightingale's graph, the terrible picture is clear. The Russians were a minor enemy. **The real enemies were cholera, typhus, and dysentery**. Once the military looked at that eloquent graph, the modern army hospital system was inevitable.

  - Transform a variable with a .orange[`stat`(`count`,`bin`,`sort`)]

- Commonly used aesthetics in data visualization: position, shape, size, color, line width, line type. 
- Some of these aesthetics can represent both continuous and discrete data (position, size, line width, color)

### - We question the world and form *Hypothesis* out of surprise
### - Hypotheses leads us to define *Questions*
### - Questions lead to *Variables*
### - Questions *with* Variables lead to *Graphs*

- Geospatial Data
>The primary mode of showing geospatial data is in the form of a map.
In addition, we can show data values in different regions by coloring those regions in the map according to the data.(Choropleth).
 In some cases, it may be helpful to distort the different regions according to some other quantity (e.g., population number) or simplify each region into a square. Such visualizations are called cartograms.
