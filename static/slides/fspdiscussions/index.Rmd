## Metaphors from Us: A Slinky !!

.pull-left[

### Movement from Potential to Kinetic Energy!!
- Some small Topics led to **yuuuge** Creative Output/Activity
- Some Big Actions/Activities led to **Simple, Deep** Realizations
- So **PE<-->KE** !

- ** But where does the Nudge come from?** 
How do we create the Nudge to move from **PE<-->KE**?

## Workshops : Doing vs Thinking

.pull-left[

- Will they stop **making stuff** once they go into **Y2/Y3/Y4**?

## No Scaffolding?
.pull-left[
- Skills are not "continued" as part of curriculum in Y2/Y3/Y4?

- Should senior year Wkshps be scaffolded on Foundation Wkshps and further?

    - But we don't seem to have "Pre-Requisites" for courses?

- Skills need an Increase in "Re-encounter value", or they cease to be Skills

**" I don't draw" should stop !!**

## Time and Choice

.pull-left[

- **Is Two Weeks of Workshop enough?**

- ** Or should there be ongoing opportunities for Skilling?**

- **What if they don't "LIKE" it? Should we push them anyway?**

- **But there is Value, and Transformation, in pushing them to do things they don't like...**

# Unstructured Skilling?

.pull-left[

- ** Continuously Available Skill Programmes**

- ** Students enroll at will**

- ** Chunking of Skill Modules!!** 

- ** Flexible Credits!!**

- ** And...Faculty?** `r emo::ji("tired")`

### Seems like a artistic way to solve Schrodinger's Wave Equation:

### Time + Choice + "Value" + Self-Transformation"
