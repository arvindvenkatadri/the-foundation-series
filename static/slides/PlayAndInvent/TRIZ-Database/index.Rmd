## TRIZ: A Workflow Review

- Find a "Problem Situation", using say 5W + H. 
- Use the Ishikawa Diagram to finds **Knobs** and their **Parameters**
- Formulate a **ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRADICTION (AC)** (a trade-off or a compromise) in "plain English using the method of manipaulation of the **Knobs**
 - Specify an **IDEAL FINAL RESULT**
 - Convert/metaphorize the **AC** into a **TECHNICAL CONTRADICTION(TC)** using **48 TRIZ PARAMETER**s


---
## TRIZ: A Workflow Review

- Look up the **CONTRADICTION MATRIX**.  
- Discover the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** you might apply
- *Un-metaphorize* the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** to apply them in a specific way in your problem and solve it. Use your **CC**, and available **Resources**!
- If possible formulate a **PHYSICAL CONTRADICTION(PC)** from your AC. 
  - E.g Something has to be hot and cold at the same time
  - Use **SEPARATION PRINCIPLES** to solve the **PC**
  - Use of **SEPARATION PRINCIPLES** may not involve much *un-metaphorization*, but applying them may be easier!!
  - But getting to a PC may not be easy.

Alice laughed. “There’s no use trying,” she said: “one can’t believe impossible things.”

“I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”]

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #1: Meat Transportation

.pull-left[
A meat plant in South America ships its product to the US. Refrigeration is required during transport to keep the meat frozen. The meat is flown to the US, so refrigeration systems were installed in cargo planes. When competition increased, the owner of the plant sought to reduce delivery cost. 

It became obvious that he must increase the amount of product per air shipment. Analysis of the situation revealed that he could compete better if **the weight of the refrigeration system were replaced with that of meat**. 


]
.pull-right[
He did exactly that. 

Flying at an altitude of 15,000–25,000 feet the air temperature is below 32 deg. F, so no refrigeration system was actually needed. 

Conclusion: **Utilization of existing resources** costing nothing brought the system closer to Ideality. 

The art of inventing is the ability to remove barriers to Ideality in order to qualitatively improve a technical system.

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #2: Red Adair and Oil Well Fires

.pull-left[An oil well in Saudi Arabia exploded and caught fire.
The result was a blazing inferno that consumed an enormous quantity of oil each day. After initial efforts to extinguish it failed, famed firefighter Red Adair was called in. Red knew that the fire could be put out if a huge amount of fire retardant foam could be dumped on the base of the well. 

There was enough foam available at the site to do the job. However, there was no hose large  enough to put all the foam on the fire fast enough. 

The small hoses that were available could not shoot the foam quickly enough
to do any good. It looked like there would have to be costly delay before a serious attempt could be made.
]

.pull-right[However, Red Adair knew just what to do. He stationed
men in a circle all around the fire, with all of the available small hoses. When everyone was ready all of the hoses were opened up and foam was directed at the fire from all directions. In this way a huge amount of foam quickly struck the source of the fire. The blaze was extinguished, and the Saudis were satisfied that Red had earned his three million dollar fee.

**Segmentation   
Excessive Action**

Solution:
- 18(Mechanical Vibration) : Make noise of your own? `r emoji("sound")` `r emoji("laugh")`
- 35(Parameter Change): Change *Bargaining Talk* to *Sweet Sound*: Play music!!`r emojifont::emoji("musical_note")`

## TRIZ Workflow: Case Study #2
### Wildlife Crossings Key to Highway Safety in Banff

.pull-left[
Why did the bear cross the Trans-Canada Highway?

We may never know, but thanks to the Banff Wildlife Crossings Project, there’s a good chance it made it to the other side.

]
.pull-right[
When the 82-kilometre section of the Trans-Canada Highway that runs through the Rocky Mountains in Banff National Park was built in the early 1950s, it wasn’t expected to be the major artery it is today. 
But as park visitation increased, traffic volume surged—and so did highway-related wildlife mortality.

Inventive Principles:
- **TC1**: 3(Local Quality), 19(Periodic Action), 35(Parameter Change), 5(Merging).....Local Quality? Parameter Change? Ok, change the road in some way...can't change all cars and definitely can't "change" animals!!

- **TC3**: ***17(Another Dimension)!!!***, 1(Segmentation), 40(Composite Materials), 33(Homogeneity)

Solution:
- (17)Another Dimension + (35)Parameter Change + 3(Local Quality) = Animal Bridge!!!
- Also 33(Homogeneity) = Equal Opportunity for Animals and Vehicles

.pull-left[
- **AC**: When diving, the water may hurt the diver if they do not land properly. 
- **Knobs**: Water(Deep/Shallow); Dive(High/Low); Weight of Diver(H/L); Posture?
- **IFR**: For high water diving, water must be “hard” to support the diver and “soft” so as not to injure the diver. 
- **TC**: Try!!
- **PC**: The physical contradiction: The water must be hard and soft at the same time.

This contradiction is resolved by **Separating** the requirements **in space**: Saturate the water with air bubbles — the pool contains both air and water.

- The Ticket Transaction is *reversed* in direction (effectively)

- Everyone in the bus is *suddenly different*: Happy, excited... (phase transition)

- Fuel Cost and Loss of Revenue as *intermediary between striking staff and the company*!

---

### TRIZ Workflow: Case Study #7: Lawrence of Arabia

Solution:
- IP10 (Prior Action): Get hold of the Howeitat tribe to unite with them and fight

- IP27 (Cheap Short Living Objects: Attack with Camels! 
This was really inspired from Lawrence's reading and knowledge of the Koran, and his statement to Feisal in the tent scene is very telling!
- IP35(Parameter Change) and IP13 (The Other Way Around): Change *the direction of the attack!* Attack by land!! `r emojifont::emoji("leftwards_arrow_with_hook")` So the "ships are near the guns, but because the guns point seaward, the "ships" cannot be sunk!

- SO: With the landward attack on camels, with the Howeitat in company, Lawrence and Ali were able to brush aside the flimsy defences at Aqaba and take it!
AND...Camels are the **Ship of the Desert!** `r emoji("camel")` `r emoji("ship")`, so that the attack **was** with **ships**!!
