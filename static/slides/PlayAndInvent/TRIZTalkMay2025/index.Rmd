## My Teaching and First Encounter with TRIZ
.pull-left[
- My Design Thinking Course [Play and Invent](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/teaching/1-play-and-invent/)

  - Based on Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Bourdieu, Edward de Bono
  
  - Some decent Socio-Cultural Ideas (David Foster Wallace)
  - Divergent and Convergent Thinking Techniques (Guilford, Wallas-Kogan)
  
  - Some Problem Analysis
  
]

.pull-right[
- But ultimately...brainstorming
- I was dissatisfied with "brainstorming"

- My own hardware design experiences at ISRO, CDOT, Wipro, TI seemed to have more structure in innovation

- Wanted to bring it to the classroom ! Didn't know how!!!


- STUMBLED upon (classical) TRIZ in 2017

#### How Did I Get into it?

- At first, I did not believe it!! It seemed magical!!
- So I read, and thought, and wrote!

## So what *is* TRIZ?

.pull-left[
![Genrikh Altshuller](images/Altshuller.454.png)
]

.pull-right[
![](images/soviet-patents.png)

- All *creative* Patents solved...CONTRADICTIONS!
]

---

## What motivated TRIZ?

.pull-left[
- Altshuller was a Patent Inspector in the Soviet Navy. 
- **Data-mined** 25K Patent Applications, and found:
- **Similar Contradictions** were found across Domains
- **Similar Inventive Solutions** were found across Domains
 - But used ***different language / terminology***
- So...how does a Plumber talk with a Heart Surgeon?
  - Watch [Grey's Anatomy](https://www.netflix.com/title/70140391) or [House](https://www.amazon.com/House-Season-1/dp/B000WCT7M8) together?

## A TRIZ Worldview: What's Your Inventive Problem?
.pull-left[
![](images/pizza.jpg)
]

.pull-right[
- Whatever can be wrong with a pizza box!! (Unless it is empty..)

- Lids get soggy with steam, and may touch the toppings!
- The Box is needed, because the hot pizza is to be delivered!!

So?

PROBLEM: Ever tried to scrape cheese off the inside of a pizza box lid?
- Csikszentmihalyi: Keep a "Surprise Journal".

## A TRIZ Worldview: What's Your Inventive Problem? (In Class)
.pull-left[
![](images/chain.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
- Chains **need to be flexible** so that can wrap around sprockets

- Chains **need to be hard** so that they don't snap

So?

PROBLEM: Ever had greasy hands trying to re-align a slipped chain?

## A Good Contradiction is ~~Half~~ the Inventive Problem



- Both *Objects* above embody a CONTRADICTION.

- This is one of the Central Ideas in (classical TRIZ).

- CONTRADICTIONs can also exist in *situations*!

## A TRIZ Worldview: A Metaphoric Language

.pull-left[
- ***Big Idea :*** Generalized Problem: "Your Problem has been solved somewhere else", in a different DOMAIN in a different LANGUAGE

- So can there be a "common" "crossover" language?
  - Altshuller invented one, with **Metaphors**
  - 48 **TRIZ Metaphors** for **stating** the Problem Contradiction
  - 40 **TRIZ Metaphors** for **Inventive Principles**

## A TRIZ Worldview: Resources
- A Unique Way of looking at **Available Resources**

.pull-left[
- One Good way to do this is using the **Ishikawa Diagram**
- Man, Material, Method, Management, Machinery (Ishikawa)
  - This diagram is used **primarily** to assign **CAUSES**
  - But it conveniently lists all the **Resources**.
  
- What things create the compromise/tradeoff?

## A TRIZ Worldview: Ideal Final Result
.pull-left[ 
- The **Ideal Final Result** 

  - A "Want my Cake and Have it Too" outlook
  
  - A uniquely TRIZ *no-compromise* formulation
  
  - A *solution* before **the** Solution
  - Focusses the Attention to specific regions of the Solution Space ( as we will see)
]


.pull-right[
- State an **Ideal Final Result**
- A basic principle of TRIZ is that systems evolve towards increased **ideality**, where ideality is defined as

$$Ideality = Benefits / (Harm + Costs)$$
- **Evolution** is in the direction of
 - ⬆ Increasing benefits
 - ⬇ Decreasing costs
 - ⬇ Decreasing harm
- IFR allows us to **invert the direction of the problem**: to come backwards from Solution towards the Situation

## TRIZ Workflow: How to Create a Contradiction

.pull-left[
- From the Ishikawa Diagram
- **One Parameter or Knob** for each **Causes** 
  
  - Each Knob creates a Certain Outcome at one Setting 

  - And another Outcome at the Opposite Setting.

- This is the Source of your Administrative Contradiction !!

## So How Do TRIZ Contradictions Work?
.pull-left[
- State your Problem in "plain English"
- "Metaphorize" your Problem using 48 TRIZ Parameters
  - You now have a **TRIZ Contradiction**
  - Maybe more than one way!!
  
  
- Look up TRIZ Generalized Solutions for your Contradiction
  - You have say 4 **TRIZ Inventive Principles**
  - These are also metaphors!
  
  
- "Un-metaphorize" them back into your problem

## TRIZ Contradiction Matrix
.pull-left[
- Uses 49 "TRIZ Standard" Parameters

- Sets off Contradictions each against the others

- 49 X 49 matrix!

- Each Cell represents a "Generalized Problem"

- Each cell has "TRIZ Inventive Principles"

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #1: Meat Transportation

- A meat plant owner in South America flies product to the United States. 
- Refrigeration is required during flight to keep the meat frozen.

He did exactly that.

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #2: Red Adair and Oil Well Fires

.pull-left[
- An oil well in Saudi Arabia exploded and caught fire.
- Initial efforts to extinguish it failed, 
- Famed firefighter Red Adair was called in. 


- There was enough foam available at the site to do the job.
- The small hoses that were available could not shoot the foam quickly enough to do any good. 


- CONTRADICTION: **How to use a Small Hose to spray Big Foam?**
]

.pull-right[
- Red Adair stationed men in a circle all around the fire, with all of the available small hoses. 
- When everyone was ready all of the hoses were opened up and foam was directed at the fire from all directions. In this way a huge amount of foam quickly struck the source of the fire. The blaze was extinguished, 
- The Saudis were satisfied that Red had earned his three million dollar fee.

Excessive Action**

## TRIZ Workflow: Case Study #2: Bus Strikes in Japan

.pull-left[
- Drivers "need" to protest against their Employers

- **Strikes hurt commuters**, who are **forced to empathize**

- Strikes do not directly "hurt the management"...which is the intent!

- When drivers return, they are apologetic...maybe.

- **IFR**: Drivers must convey their anger only to employers who are far away. 
- **TC**: Improve *Force(10)* ( i.e.of the Strike) and not worsen * Object generated Harmful Effects(31)* ( i.e. on themselves nor on commuters)
- **AC**: We want to strike against our employers, but they are not riding on the buses we drive !! Commuters are!!
- **"PC"**: Drivers must strike AND not strike at the same time! ( From whose **point of view** !! )

- **IP13(The Other Way Around!!)**: What points one way and can be turned around? Bus Routes? Ticket Transactions?

- **3(Local Quality)**: Something should be different *inside* the bus!!

- **36(Phase Transition**): Hmm..everybody involved must "change dramatically"...who? Commuters? Drivers ? 

- **24(Intermediary)**: Fuel Cost and Loss of Revenue as intermediary between striking staff and the company!

How can we use these...

Solution:

- FREE, FREE, FREE !! The Bus Ticket Transaction is **IP13:the other way around**! So Conductors *pay* commuters..by not charging!! 

- Run buses properly on time! Use Fuel and be on Time! That'll fetch the Managers! **24(Intermediary)**

- Everybody in the Bus Sympathises! **36(Phase Transition**) and **3(Local Quality)**

## TRIZ: Workflow Summary

 - Find a **PROBLEM** (Bourdieu, Csikszentmihalyi, David Foster Wallace)
 - Look at **RESOURCES** (knobs) within the Problem and how they affect the situation (Open Source TRIZ)
  
 - Turn the knobs to formulate a **ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRADICTION** (a trade-off or a compromise in plain English)
 
 - Specify an **IDEAL FINAL RESULT**
 
 - Convert/metaphorize the **CONTRADICTION** into **TRIZ PARAMETER**s
 
 - Look up the **TRIZ CONTRADICTION MATRIX**. Discover the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** you might apply
 
 - *Un-metaphorize* the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** to apply them in a specific way in your problem and solve it!
