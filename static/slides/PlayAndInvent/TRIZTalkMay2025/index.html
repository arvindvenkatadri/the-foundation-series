## Agenda
.pull-left[
- A Little about me

- How did I encounter TRIZ?

- How do I teach TRIZ: Something to show you
]

.pull-right[
- How did the GenTRIZ Training Work for me?

- How will I use it?

- How can you?

## Something of Myself
.pull-left[

.pull-right[
- Masters in Electronics from IIT-Roorkee (1987)
- Past: 
  - ISRO ; CDOT ; 
  - Wipro Technologies; Texas Instruments; 
  - Akshara Foundation; NSRCEL(IIM-B)
- Present: 
  - Srishti Manipal Institute of Art/Design (since 2014)
  - Dayanand Sagar School of Commerce and Mgmt (since 2022)

## My Teaching and First Encounter with TRIZ
.pull-left[
- My Design Thinking Course &lt;u&gt;[Play and Invent](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/teaching/1-play-and-invent/)&lt;/u&gt;

  - Based on Csikszentmihalyi, Bourdieu, and de Bono
  
  - Some decent Socio-Cultural Ideas (David Foster Wallace)
  - Divergent and Convergent Thinking Techniques (Guilford, Wallas-Kogan)
  
  - Some Problem Analysis
  
]

.pull-right[
- But ultimately...brainstorming
- I was dissatisfied with "brainstorming"

- My own hardware design experiences at ISRO, CDOT, Wipro, TI seemed to have more structure in innovation

- Wanted to bring it to the classroom ! Didn't know how!!!

#### How Did I Get into it?

- At first, I did not believe it!! It seemed magical!!
- So I read, and thought, and wrote!

## Worldviews in (classical) TRIZ

## A TRIZ Worldview: What's Your Inventive Problem?
.pull-left[
![](images/pizza.jpg)
]

.pull-right[
- Whatever can be wrong with a pizza box!! (Unless it is empty..)

- Lids get soggy with steam, and may touch the toppings!
- The Box is needed, because the hot pizza is to be delivered!!

So?

PROBLEM: Ever tried to scrape cheese off the inside of a pizza box lid?
- **.orange[Csikszentmihalyi: Keep a "Surprise Journal"]**

## A TRIZ Worldview: What's Your Inventive Problem? (In Class)
.pull-left[
.polaroid[![](images/chain.jpg)]
]
.pull-right[
- Chains **need to be flexible** so that can wrap around sprockets

- Chains **need to be hard** so that they don't snap

So?

PROBLEM: Ever had greasy hands trying to re-align a slipped chain?
]

## A Good Contradiction is ~~Half~~ the Inventive Problem



- Both *.red[Objects]* above embody a CONTRADICTION.

- This is one of the Central Ideas in (classical TRIZ).

- CONTRADICTIONs can also exist in *.red[situations]* !

&lt;center&gt;

## A TRIZ Worldview: A Metaphoric Language
- ***Big Idea :*** Generalized Problem: .orange["Your Problem has been solved somewhere else"], in a different DOMAIN in a different LANGUAGE
- So can there be a "common" "crossover" language?
  - How does a Plumber talk with a Heart Surgeon?
- Altshuller invented one, with **Metaphors**
  - 48 **TRIZ Metaphors** for **stating** the Problem Contradiction
  - 40 **TRIZ Metaphors** for **Inventive Principles**

## A TRIZ Worldview: Resources

.pull-left[
- One Good way to do this is using the **Ishikawa Diagram**

## A TRIZ Worldview: Ideal Final Result (IFR)
.pull-left[ 
- The **Ideal Final Result** 

  - A "Want my Cake and Have it Too" outlook
  
  - A uniquely TRIZ *no-compromise* formulation
  
  - A *solution* before **the** Solution
  - Focusses the Attention to specific regions of the Solution Space ( as we will see)
]


.pull-right[
- State an **Ideal Final Result**
- A basic principle of TRIZ is that systems evolve towards increased **ideality**, where ideality is defined as

`$$Ideality = Benefits / (Harm + Costs)$$`
- **Evolution** is in the direction of
 - ⬆ Increasing benefits
 - ⬇ Decreasing costs
 - ⬇ Decreasing harm
- IFR allows us to **invert the direction of the problem**: to come backwards from Solution towards the Situation

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #1: Meat Transportation

.pull-left[
- A meat plant owner in South America flies product to the United States. 
- Refrigeration is required during flight to keep the meat frozen. 
- Competition increased, Need to reduce delivery cost. 
- It became obvious that he must increase the amount of product per air shipment. 
- Refrigeration system... 
- CONTRADICTION: **How to increase shipment AND keep it frozen**? 

He did exactly that.

.pull-right[
- **Utilization of existing resources** Flying at an altitude of 15,000–25,000 feet *the air temperature is below 32 deg. F*, so no refrigeration system was actually needed.

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #2: Red Adair and Oil Well Fires

.pull-left[
- An oil well in Saudi Arabia exploded and caught fire.
- Initial efforts to extinguish it failed, 
- Famed firefighter Red Adair was called in. 


- There was enough foam available at the site to do the job.
- The small hoses that were available could not shoot the foam quickly enough to do any good. 


- CONTRADICTION: **How to use a Small Hose to spray Big Foam?**
]

.pull-right[
- Red Adair stationed men in a circle all around the fire, with all of the available small hoses. 
- When everyone was ready all of the hoses were opened up and foam was directed at the fire from all directions. In this way a huge amount of foam quickly struck the source of the fire. The blaze was extinguished, 
- The Saudis were satisfied that Red had earned his three million dollar fee.
- INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES: **Segmentation   
Excessive Action**

### TRIZ Workflow: Case Study: Plastics in the Water

- **AC**: Plastics are polluting the oceans, they are impossible to retrieve from there; 80% of all ocean plastics come from ~1600 rivers!

- **IFR**: Rivers must flow, but plastic must not.

- **PC**: The Plastics must be in the water AND not in the water at the same time.

## TRIZ Workflow: Case Study #2: Bus Strikes in Japan

- Drivers "need" to protest against their Employers

- **Strikes unfortunately hurt commuters**, who are **forced to empathize**

- Strikes ***do not directly "hurt the management"***...which is the intent!

- When drivers return, they are apologetic...maybe.

Solution:

- FREE, FREE, FREE !! The Bus Ticket Transaction is **IP13 (The other way around)**! So Conductors *pay* commuters..by not charging!! 

- Run buses properly on time! Use up Fuel and be on Time, but ***NO REVENUE*** ! That'll fetch the Managers! **IP24 (Intermediary)**

### So, Why Learn TRIZ?

- It contains the ***distilled inventive wisdom of humanity***

- Can confer super powers on the user

  - Makes you believe in impossible things and make them happen
  - An enhanced world-view
  - Makes you a problem-solver
  - And a "thought leader" at the workspace, maybe?

- Be ready to be called "crazy" and get incredulous looks!(Personal Experience)
  
- And of course, there is money....and name and fame if you want it!
