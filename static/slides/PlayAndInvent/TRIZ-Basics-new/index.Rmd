## What's Your Problem?
.pull-left[
![](images/pizza.jpg)
]

.pull-right[
- Whatever can be wrong with a pizza box!!

- Lids get soggy with steam, and may touch the toppings!
- Steam naturally happens because pizza is hot !!

So?

CONTRADICTION: Ever tried to scrape cheese off the inside of a pizza box lid?

## What's Your Problem?
.pull-left[
![](images/chain.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
- Chains *need* to be flexible so that can wrap around sprockets
- Chains *need* to be hard so that they don't snap

So?

CONTRADICTION: Ever had greasy hands trying to re-align a slipped chain?

.pull-left[
- Altshuller **data-mined** 25K Patent Applications

- **Similar Contradictions** were found across Domains

- **Similar Inventive Solutions** were found across Domains

- But...how does a Plumber talk with a Heart Surgeon?

## So, a Metaphoric Language

.pull-left[
- ***Big Idea :*** Generalized Problem: "Your Problem has been solved somewhere else", in a different DOMAIN in a different LANGUAGE

- So can there be a "common" "crossover" language?

## A TRIZ Worldview: Resources
.pull-left[
- A Unique Way of looking at **Available Resources**

- The thing causing the problem is also a resource?
  - [Could Titanic have used the iceberg? PDF](https://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/archives/2003/03/g/07.pdf)
  
- Helps avoid [Functional Fixedness](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/functional-fixedness)

## A TRIZ Worldview: IFR
.pull-left[ 
- The **Ideal Final Result** 

  - A "Want my Cake and Have it Too" outlook
  - A uniquely TRIZ *no-compromise* formulation
  - A *solution* before **the** Solution
  - Focusses the Attention to specific regions of the Solution Space ( as we will see)
]

.pull-right[
- Helps [refine the problem](https://metodolog.ru/triz-journal/archives/1998/06/d/index.htm)


- Eliminates the deficiencies of the original system
- Preserves the advantages of the original system
- Does not make the system more complicated (uses free or available resources.)
- Does not introduce new disadvantages
- (https://metodolog.ru/triz-journal/archives/1997/02/a/index.html)
]

---

## TRIZ Worldview: Specify the Ideal Final Result (IFR)

.pull-left[
- State an **Ideal Final Result**
- A basic principle of TRIZ is that systems evolve towards increased **ideality**, where ideality is defined as

$$Ideality = Benefits / (Harm + Costs)$$
- **Evolution** is in the direction of
 - ⬆ Increasing benefits
 - ⬇ Decreasing costs
 - ⬇ Decreasing harm
- IFR allows us to **invert the direction of the problem**: to come backwards from Solution towards the Situation
]

.pull-right[

The ***extreme result*** of this evolution is the Ideal Final Result:
 - It has all the benefits,  
 - none of the harm, and
 - none of the costs of the original problem.
 - The Ideal Final Result describes the solution to a technical problem, **independent of the mechanism or constraints of the original problem**. 
 - It occupies no space, has no weight, requires no labour, requires no maintenance. 
 
]

---

## A TRIZ Worldview: Contradictions
.pull-left[
  
- **Contradictions** exist at multiple levels
  - *Administrative*. [Oh those Russians...](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/recliner/oh-those-russians-boney-m/21642/1)

  - *Technical* (TRIZ Metaphors, as we'll see)
  
  - *Physical* [An Impossible Sounding Statement](https://aliceinwonderland.fandom.com/wiki/Six_Impossible_Things) which we might discover...
  
      - Ever heard of  [Hiranyakashipu?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiranyakashipu)
]

.pull-right[
![](images/Hiranyakashipu.jpg)
]

---

## So How Do Metaphors Work in Classical TRIZ?
.pull-left[
- State your Problem in "plain English"
- "Metaphorize" your Problem using 48 TRIZ Parameters
  - You now have a **TRIZ Contradiction**
  - Maybe more than one way!!
  
  
- Look up TRIZ Generalized Solutions for your Contradiction
  - You have say 4 **TRIZ Inventive Principles**
  - These are also metaphors!
  
  
- "Un-metaphorize" them back into your problem
]


.pull-right[

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #1: Meat Transportation

.pull-left[
- A meat plant owner in South America flies product to the United States. 
- Refrigeration is required during flight to keep the meat frozen. 
- Competition increased, Need to reduce delivery cost. 
- It became obvious that he must increase the amount of product per air shipment. 
- Refrigeration system... 
- CONTRADICTION: **How to increase shipment AND keep it frozen**? 

He did exactly that. 
]
.pull-right[
- **Utilization of existing resources** Flying at an altitude of 15,000–25,000 feet *the air temperature is below 32 deg. F*, so no refrigeration system was actually needed.

## TRIZ Workflow: Story #2: Red Adair and Oil Well Fires

.pull-left[
- An oil well in Saudi Arabia exploded and caught fire.
- Initial efforts to extinguish it failed, 
- Famed firefighter Red Adair was called in. 


- There was enough foam available at the site to do the job.
- The small hoses that were available could not shoot the foam quickly enough to do any good. 


- CONTRADICTION: **How to use a Small Hose to spray Big Foam?**
]

.pull-right[
- Red Adair stationed men in a circle all around the fire, with all of the available small hoses. 
- When everyone was ready all of the hoses were opened up and foam was directed at the fire from all directions. In this way a huge amount of foam quickly struck the source of the fire. The blaze was extinguished, 
- The Saudis were satisfied that Red had earned his three million dollar fee.
- INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES: **Segmentation   
Excessive Action**

## TRIZ Workflow: Formulate a Problem Description
.pull-left[
- Use your [*CULTURAL CAPITAL*](https://culturallearningalliance.org.uk/what-is-cultural-capital/) and your **DOMAINs** to write a PROBLEM in simple English
- Ask: **5W+H**
  - **What** does the problem seem to be?
  - **Who** has the problem?  
  - **When** does the problem occur? All the time? Under certain circumstances? 
  - **Where** does the problem occur? 
  - **Why** does the problem occur?(.small.orange["Ask why 5 times" -- W. Edwards Deming])
          - **How** does the problem occur?

## TRIZ Workflow: Look the "Resources" and Causes
.pull-left[
To refine our Problem, what Resources do we have?
- One Good way to do this is using the **Ishikawa Diagram**
- Man, Material, Method, Management, Machinery (Ishikawa)
  - This diagram is used **primarily** to assign **CAUSES**
  - But it conveniently lists all the **Resources**.
  - What things create the compromise/tradeoff?

## TRIZ Workflow: Inspect the Ishikawa Diagram

.pull-left[
- From the Ishikawa Diagram
  - What is **One Parameter or Knob** for each of the **Causes** that you have listed therein?
- Let us make a list for each Knob/Object:
  - What is the **Knob** meant to do? What is its main Purpose?
  - What are the other Accompanying Objects that it works with?
  ]
.pull-right[
- What are the **current Settings** for each Knob?
- Change the Setting of Each Knob to its **natural opposite extreme**. What Happens?
  - You will see that in many cases, each Knob creates a Certain Outcome at one Setting and another Outcome at the Opposite Setting.
- This is the Source of your Administrative Contradiction !!
]  
What sort of Contradictions do we see in familiar objects today? What is good and what is not so good? Could that be the source of a problem to solve?

## TRIZ Workflow: Case Study #3
### Wildlife Crossings Key to Highway Safety in Banff

.pull-left[
Why did the bear cross the Trans-Canada Highway?

We may never know, but thanks to the Banff Wildlife Crossings Project, there’s a good chance it made it to the other side.

]
.pull-right[
When the 82-kilometre section of the Trans-Canada Highway that runs through the Rocky Mountains in Banff National Park was built in the early 1950s, it wasn’t expected to be the major artery it is today. 
But as park visitation increased, traffic volume surged—and so did highway-related wildlife mortality.

### TRIZ Workflow: Case Study #2: Wildlife Crossings in Banff


Inventive Principles:
- **TC1**: 3(Local Quality), 19(Periodic Action), 35(Parameter Change), 5(Merging).....Local Quality? Parameter Change? Ok, change the road in some way...can't change all cars and definitely can't "change" animals!!

- **TC2**: 35(Parameter Change), 18(Mechanical Vibration), 34(Rejecting and Regenerating Parts). 

- **TC3**: ***17(Another Dimension)!!!***, 1(Segmentation), 40(Composite Materials), 33(Homogeneity)

Solution:
- (17)Another Dimension + (35)Parameter Change + 3(Local Quality) = Animal Bridge!!!
- Also 33(Homogeneity) = Equal Opportunity for Animals and Vehicles

## TRIZ Workflow: Case Study : Arc of the Diver

.pull-left[
- **AC**: When diving, the water may hurt the diver if they do not land properly. 
- **Knobs**: Water(Deep/Shallow); Dive(High/Low); Weight of Diver(H/L); Posture?
- **IFR**: For high water diving, water must be “hard” to support the diver and “soft” so as not to injure the diver. 
- **TC**: Try!!
- **PC**: The physical contradiction: The water must be hard and soft at the same time. 

]


.pull-right[
- Solution: 
This contradiction is resolved by **Separating** the requirements **in space**: Saturate the water with air bubbles — the pool contains both air and water.
