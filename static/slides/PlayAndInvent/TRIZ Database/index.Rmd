## TRIZ: A Workflow Review
```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

## CREATE WORKFLOW DIAGRAM HERE
```

 - Specify an **IDEAL FINAL RESULT**
 
 - A. Formulate a **ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRADICTION (AC)** (a trade-off or a compromise) in "plain English
 
 
 - Convert/metaphorize the **AC** into a **TECHNICAL CONTRADICTION(TC)** using **39 TRIZ PARAMETER**s
 
  - Look up the **CONTRADICTION MATRIX**
 
  - Discover the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** you might apply
 
  - *Un-metaphorize* the **INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES** to apply them in a specific way in your problem and solve it
  
 - B. If possible develop a **PHYSICAL CONTRADICTION(PC)** from your AC. 
  - E.g Something has to be hot and cold at the same time
  - Use **SEPARATION PRINCIPLES** to solve the **PC**
  - Use of **SEPARATION PRINCIPLES** may not involve much *un-metaphorization*, but getting to a PC may not be easy.

## TRIZ Workflow: Example #1: Meat Transportation


.pull-left[
A meat plant in South America ships its product to the United States. Refrigeration is required during transport to keep the meat frozen. The meat is flown to the United States, so refrigeration systems were installed in cargo planes. When competition increased, the owner of the plant sought to reduce delivery cost. It became obvious that he must increase the amount of product per air shipment. Analysis of the situation revealed that he could compete better if the weight of the refrigeration system were replaced with that of meat. He did exactly that. Flying at an altitude of 15,000–25,000 feet the air temperature is below 32 deg. F, so no refrigeration system was actually needed.

Conclusion: Utilization of existing resources costing nothing brought the system closer to Ideality. The art of inventing is the ability to remove barriers to Ideality in order to qualitatively improve a technical system. (In this book we are talking only about technical systems; however, this statement can be applied to any system.)

## TRIZ Workflow: Example #2: Oil Well Fires

An oil well in Saudi Arabia exploded and caught fire.
The result was a blazing inferno that consumed an enormous quantity of oil each day. After initial efforts to extinguish it failed, famed firefighter Red Adair was called
in. Red knew that the fire could be put out if a huge amount
of fire retardant foam could be dumped on the base of the
well. There was enough foam available at the site to do
the job. However, there was no hose large  enough to put
all the foam on the fire fast enough. The small hoses that
were available could not shoot the foam quickly enough
to do any good. It looked like there would have to be costly
delay before a serious attempt could be made.
However, Red Adair knew just what to do. He stationed
men in a circle all around the fire, with all of the available small hoses. When everyone was ready all of the hoses were
opened up and foam was directed at the fire from all directions. In this way a huge amount of foam quickly struck
the source of the fire. The blaze was extinguished, and the
Saudis were satisfied that Red had earned his three million
dollar fee.

## TRIZ Workflow: Example #3: Spotify Ad

.pull-left[
- **AC**: I want to chill but Mom wants me to take her veggie shopping. I have to put up with waste of time and possibly boredom. 
- **Knobs** (short list): 
  - Travel Time(L/S); Purchase Time(L/S); Noise(Loud/Soft); Bargaining Talk(Long/Short)
- **Output**: Stress / Boredom / Waste of Time
- **IFR**: *"I should go AND not go to the market at the same time"*

- **TC**: From the 39 TRIZ parameters:
  - **TC1**: Increase *Productivity(39)* and not worsen *Stress(11)*
  - **TC2**: Improve *Loss of Time(25)* and not worsen *Effect of External Harmful Factors(30)*
  ]
  
.pull-right[
Inventive Principles:
- TC1: 10(Prior Action), 37(Thermal Expansion), 14(Spheroidality).....hmm, not very inspiring, unless 37 means *get angry with Mom* !! Never!!
- TC2: 35(Parameter Change), 18(Mechanical Vibration)!!, 34(Rejecting and Regenerating Parts). 

Solution:
- 18(Mechanical Vibration) : Make noise of your own? `r emoji("sound")` `r emoji("laugh")`
- 35(Parameter Change): Change *Bargaining Talk* to *Sweet Sound*: Play music!!`r emojifont::emoji("musical_note")`
- Also 14(Spheroidality): Wear "spherical" headphones!!`r emoji("headphones")`! Create a "sound sphere"! Long shot!!
- SO: with music on, I was **in the market, and not in the market** !!IFR achieved !! Ta Da !!

## TRIZ Workflow: Example #6: Arc of the Diver

For high water diving, water must be “hard” to support the diver and “soft” so as not to injure the diver. The physical contradiction: The water must be hard and soft at the same time. This contradiction is resolved by separating the requirements in space: Saturate the water with air bubbles — the pool contains both air and water.
