abstract: Getting Veggies from the crowded Subzi Mandi? That is surely a boring task
  for most people! And to **have** to accompany your Mom while she gets them is probably
  worse. How can you wriggle out of that job, and still not hurt Mom's feelings? TRIZ
  has the answer!

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Here we go with another of my TRIZ Chronicles. The first edition
analysing the famous movie Lawrence of Arabia is
<a href="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The recent series of ads by Spotify have been very well received, by the
ad industry as well. There have been several of these ads, each with a
solid little story and a great punch line. There is one popular one that
I have selected here, featuring a Mother shopping for veggies, while her
son <em>watches</em> (and “listens”) to her bargaining with the shopkeeper.
Here I take just that highly effective ad and interpret it from a <em>TRIZ</em>
viewpoint.</p>
<p>This piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative Thinking and
Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled <em>Play and Invent</em>, over the past 8
years or more at the <em>Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and
Technology, Bangalore, India</em>. (<a href="https://srishtimanipalinstitute.in" class="uri">https://srishtimanipalinstitute.in</a>).</p>

<h2>The Famous Spotify Ad</h2>
<p>Let us watch the Spotify ad first, before analyzing it!</p>

<h2>The Young Man’s Problem</h2>
<p>In order to make a <em>story</em> out of this, I want make a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist"><strong>Protagonist</strong></a> out the
young man in the ad. It is he who has the problem and he who is going to
apply TRIZ to solve it. I discuss the source of his Problem and give an
analysis of the Problem from a (classical) TRIZ perspective, including
the formulation of the <em>Contradiction</em>, <em>Identification of Causes</em>, the
statement of the <em>Ideal Final Result</em>, and finally using the <em>TRIZ
Contradiction Matrix</em> to find <em>Inventive Principles</em>, that lead to the
solution, which of course, is meant to unerringly include Spotify !</p>
<p>First a philosophical digression:—</p>
<p>Several authors have taken a Game View of life. James P Carse’s famous
book titled <em>Finite and Infinite Games</em> <a href="https://fs.blog/finite-and-infinite-games/"><strong>speaks
of</strong></a> Play, Types of Games,
Rules, Winning and our own aims in the Game itself. A similar
articulation is, in my opinion, that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly
Csikszentlmihalyi</a>
in his concept of Flow, shown here below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="sketchplanations-match-challenge-with-skills-for-flow-at-work.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">From
Sketchplanations</p>
</div>
<p>When the Game presents very little Challenge, we are <em>bored</em>. When the
Game demands extreme skills the challenge is too much for us and we
experience <em>anxiety</em>. When the Challenge presented is just barely
matched by our Skill, we are in the zone of <em>Flow</em>, or what I call
<em>Play</em>.</p>
<p>A good metaphoric image for this experience is as follows:— that we
live in a space where the <em>Floor of Boredom</em> is always rising and would
crush us against our <em>Ceiling of Anxiety</em>. One Way to deal with this is
to develop more Skills and <em>push the Ceiling away</em>, effectively moving
into the zone of Flow. Another Way of looking at this is what Carse
suggests: <em>When Play is no longer possible, change the Game.</em></p>
<p>So what does all this have to do with getting veggies?</p>
<p>The ad is, in my opinion, all about Boredom, and how to avoid it. And
not offend anybody. The Young Man (hereinafter, “YM”) simply has to
accompany his Mom, and be there while she gets the veggies. I will
exaggerate his irritation and his boredom at the risk of offending young
people likely to read this, and say that <em>he would rather not be there</em>
but he does not want to hurt Mom.</p>
<p>We are now ready for the TRIZ based Analysis of this Problem!</p>

<div id="a-triz-analysis-of-a-visit-to-the-subzi-mandi" class="section level2">
<h2>A TRIZ Analysis of a Visit to the Subzi Mandi</h2>
<p>For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as
<a href="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"><strong>before</strong></a>:</p>
<p>First, using the method described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k"><em>Open Source
TRIZ</em></a>, we identify <em>knobs</em>
or <em>parameters</em> within the situation and see how turning these could
lead to identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a
<em>Contradiction</em>.</p>
<p>Here below is a quick <em>Ishikawa Diagram</em> to help us identify the
Parameters of this Problem:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Turning the <em>knobs/parameters</em> in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if
the YM goes to the market with Mom, he would most likely get bored, but
would please Mom. If he doesn’t go, then he chills at home, but Mom is
going to justifiably furious. Herein lies the <em>Contradiction</em>, which we
can now specify as an <a href="https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp"><strong>Administrative
Contradiction(AC)</strong></a> in
<em>plain English</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<strong>AC</strong>: The YM wants to chill at home but Mom wants him to
take her veggie shopping. He has to put up with the <em><code>Waste of Time</code></em>,
and being bored, and <em><code>Stress</code></em> at being away from friends.
</center>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa
Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ <em>Ideal Final Result</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<strong>IFR</strong>: The YM must go to the Market and not be
bored.
</center>
</blockquote>
<p>Note again the impossible sounding way of expressing the IFR! One needs
practice, like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, who could think of <em>Six
Impossible Things before Breakfast</em> ! Also note there could be other
ways of specifying the IFR. See below, section <a href="#alternative-ideas-for-ifr">Alternative Ideas for
IFR</a>.</p>
<p>Let us take the AC and convert it into a <em>Technical Contradiction(TC)</em>,
keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the <em>48 TRIZ Parameters</em> in
the <a href="/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf"><em>TRIZ Contradiction Matrix</em>
<strong>(PDF)</strong></a> and see which
Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what
we can obtain. We will analyze each Contradiction both ways<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- TC 1</strong>: Improve <code>Loss of Time</code> (26) and not worsen
<code>Effect of External Harmful Factors</code> (30)</p>
<p><strong>- TC 2</strong>: Improve <code>Increase Productivity</code> (44) and not worsen
<code>Stress</code> (19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that while going to the
Market may be unavoidable, Boredom need not ensue. Parameters chosen
from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as <em>metaphors</em> for the knobs that
lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of <em>making
metaphors</em>. We could easily have chosen the Parameter <code>Noise(29)</code> as the
“metaphoric thing” to avoid, but the current IFR doesn’t quite support
that. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for
imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the <em>language of TRIZ</em>.</p>
<p>We could also formulate a <em>Physical Contradiction(PC)</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<strong>PC</strong>: The YM must be in the market and not be in the market
at the same time.
</center>
</blockquote>
<p>which is aimed squarely at one of the <em>Assumptions</em> in the Problem, that
the YM simply has to go. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we
could obtain a very different set of AC and PC. See below, section
<a href="#alternative-ideas-for-ifr">Alternative Ideas for IFR</a>.</p>
<p>In a future post, we will deal with using the <em>PC</em> and the <em>TRIZ
Separation Principles</em> to solve Problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="solving-the-technical-contradiction" class="section level2">
<h2>Solving the Technical Contradiction</h2>
<p>Let us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive
at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution
for TC-1 in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="matrix.png" width="958" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The two squares for the TC1 have been circled in red, solving TC-1.</p>
<p>The Inventive Principles are:(TC1, TC2, both ways)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>1(Segmentation)</p></li>
<li><p>35(Parameter Change)</p></li>
<li><p>21(Skipping)</p></li>
<li><p>18(Mechanical Vibration) (<strong>!!</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p>2(Taking Out/Separation)</p></li>
<li><p>10(Prior Action)</p></li>
<li><p>36(Phase Transitions)</p>
<p>and with TC2:</p></li>
<li><p>3(Local Quality)</p></li>
<li><p>14(Spheroidality/Curvature)</p></li>
<li><p>9(Preliminary Anti-Action)</p></li>
<li><p>37(Thermal Expansion)</p></li>
<li><p>40(Composite Materials)</p></li>
<li><p>25(Self Service)</p></li>
<li><p>24(Intermediary)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That is a considerable list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some
these Inventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we
<em>Generalized Solutions</em> we try to map these back into the Problem at
hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>35(Parameter Change)</strong>: Which Parameter to change? Location? No.
Sound? Change the “Bargaining Talk” into what? Sweet Musical
Lyrics!!🎵🤣</li>
<li><strong>18(Mechanical Vibration)</strong> : What, make noise of your own? Yes!
Play Music !!🔉 🤣</li>
<li><strong>14(Spheroidality)</strong>: Wear “spherical” headphones!!🎧! Create a
“sound sphere”! This is a long shot!!</li>
<li><strong>3(Local Quality)</strong>: also indicates the creation of a “local”
cocoon around the YM, but needs to be combined with <em>18(Mechanical
Vibration)</em> to truly arrive at the musical solution!</li>
</ul>
<p>One could make decent interpretations of <strong>2(Taking Out/Separation)</strong>,
and <strong>24(Intermediary)</strong>, but we are already there! The rest are perhaps
(at least to me!) not very evocative, unless <strong>37(Thermal Expansion)</strong>
means “throw a temper tantrum at Mom”? Never! So there you have it! The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwdQx2P_ytk"><strong>Cinderella song</strong></a>
played on Spotify becomes not just a <em>noise canceller</em> but actually
seems to substitute the very conversation between Mom and the vendor.
And the YM has successfully attained Flow ! And the IFR too, since with
the music in his head, he is effectively “in the marketplace <em>and</em> not
in the marketplace <em>at the same time</em>!</p>
<p>And I attained Flow in writing this!!</p>
</div>
<div id="alternative-ideas-for-ifr" class="section level2">
<h2>Alternative Ideas for IFR</h2>
<p>We note in passing that there is more than one way of formulating the
<em>Ideal Final Result</em>. Here are two more examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<p><strong>IFR2</strong>: The veggies should arrive without (the YM) going to the
Market</p>
<p><strong>IFR3</strong>: Food should be prepared without having to go buy veggies.</p>
</center>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly these are at least as good as the one we have chosen, sounding
nicely “impossible” in their own right! The point is that in the
analysis of the Problem, we do need to ask <em>Who has the Problem,</em> as we
did<em>,</em> and the IFR needs to stem from there. These alternative IFRs
could well be the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~hauser/Papers/Gaskin_Griffin_Hauser_et_al%20VOC%20Encyclopedia%202011.pdf"><strong>Voice of (another)
Customer</strong></a>.</p>

please send me a DM! Thanks !</p>
