<h2>Some Worked examples</h2>
<p>Let us consider some simple real life situations that we may have experienced. We will analyse these situations and arrive at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players or AGENTS</li>
<li>Their Possible ACTIONS</li>
<li>Their 4Rs, and if they are identical, or not</li>
<li>Payoffs and Matrix</li>
<li>Understand whether it is a Prisonersâ€™ Dilemma, or Stag Hunt, or Chicken, or maybe not model-able as a Game.</li>
</ul>
