<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Here we go with another of my <em>TRIZ Chronicles</em> ! The earlier editions
are here: <a href="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/" title="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"><strong>Lawrence of

<p>This is another piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative
Thinking and Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled <em>Play and Invent</em>,

<div id="rivers-of-plastic" class="section level1">
<h1>Rivers of Plastic</h1>
<p>According to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ocean-plastics" title="Our World in Data"><strong>Our World in
Data</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Previous research suggested that only a handful of rivers transports
almost all of the plastic to the sea – new research suggests this is
not the case.</p>
<p><img src="plastic-rivers.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>80% of the world’s ocean plastics enter the ocean via rivers and
coastlines. The other 20% come from marine sources such as fishing
nets, ropes, and fleets. To tackle plastic pollution we need to know
where these plastics are coming from. Previous studies suggested that
a very small number of rivers were responsible for the vast majority
of ocean plastics: 60% to 90% of plastics came from only ten rivers.</p>
<p>Higher-resolution mapping and consideration for factors such as
climate, terrain, land use, and distance to the ocean suggests <strong><em>that
many smaller rivers play a bigger role than we thought</em></strong>. It takes
1,600 of the biggest emitting rivers to account for 80% of plastic
inputs to the ocean.</p>
<p>It is estimated that 81% of ocean plastics come from Asian rivers. The
Philippines alone contribute around one-third of the global total.
Since the number of contributing rivers is much higher than previously
thought, we will need <strong><em>global efforts</em></strong> to improve waste management
and plastic collection rather than targeting only a few of the largest
rivers.</p>
<p>The latest research, which was just published in Science Advances,
updates our understanding of how these plastics are distributed.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Lourens Meijer et al. (2021) developed higher-resolution modeling of
global riverine plastics. They found that rivers emitted around 1
million tonnes of plastics into the oceans in 2015 (with an
uncertainty ranging from 0.8 to 2.7 million tonnes). Around one-third
of the 100,000 river outlets that they modeled contributed to this.
The other two-thirds emitted almost no plastic to the ocean. It’s an
important point because we might think that most, if not all, rivers
are contributing to the problem. This is not the case.</p>
<p>But, importantly, the latest research suggests that smaller rivers
play a much larger role than previously thought. In the chart we see
the comparison of the latest research (in red) with the two earlier
studies which mapped global riverine inputs. This chart shows how many
of the top-emitting rivers (on the x-axis) make up a given percentage
of plastic inputs (y-axis). Note that the number of rivers on the
x-axis is given on a logarithmic scale.[<strong><em>emphasis mine</em></strong>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the problem is more widespread <strong>at source</strong> and therefore
distributed local solutions are needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-is-there-a-solution" class="section level1">
<h1>So, Is there a Solution?</h1>
<p>It seems we need to prevent plastics entering the oceans, by preventing
their flow in our rivers and streams, effectively dealing with the
problem <em>at source</em>. And that such a solution needs to be in widespread
use ( &gt;1600 rivers ) in order for it to be successful. So it needs to
be simple, effective and not terribly costly.</p>
<p>It seems that the beautiful city of Amsterdam, with its lovely canals,
has a solution already!</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>In the following, we will analyze this solution from a TRIZ standpoint.
We will construct <strong>Contradictions</strong>, specify the <strong>Ideal Final
Result</strong>, and find solutions using the <strong>Contradiction Matrix</strong>. We will
then interpret and apply the <strong>Inventive Principles</strong> suggested by the
matrix into the problem and show how the video above can be depicted as
yet another TRIZ solution! We will also very briefly foray into using
another aspect of TRIZ, namely the <strong>Separation Principles</strong> this time.</p>
<div id="a-triz-analysis-of-the-amsterdam-bubble-barrier" class="section level2">
<h2>A TRIZ Analysis of the Amsterdam Bubble Barrier</h2>
<p>For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as
<a href="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/" title="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"><strong>before</strong></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, using the method described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k" title="Open Source TRIZ on YouTube"><strong>Open Source
TRIZ</strong></a><strong>,</strong>
we identify <em>knobs</em> or <em>parameters</em> within the situation</p></li>
<li><p>We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /
Cause for a Problem in the form of a <em>Contradiction</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and
look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive
Principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.</p>
<p><img src="TRIZ.png" width="331" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here below is a quick <em>Ishikawa Diagram</em> to help us identify the
<em>Parameters</em> of this Problem:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Each of the above terms in the Ishikawa can be a <strong>knob</strong> for us.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k" title="Open Source TRIZ on Youtube"><strong>Turning the <em>knobs/parameters</em> in the Ishikawa
Diagram</strong></a>,
we try to improve a certain Parameter or we try to reduce its effect. In
doing so we could construct several alternative <strong>Problem
Descriptions</strong>. ( Of course not all Parameters may be accessible in a
given situation )</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We want to deal with the (hopefully) smaller quantities of plastic
closer to source, rather than the much larger quantities as we get
nearer and into the high seas.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly we want the rivers to flow and give us our sense of
<a href="https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/105/the-wind-in-the-willows/1795/the-open-road/" title="The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame"><strong>beauty, serenity and movement, and
poetry</strong></a>,
but the same flow should not transport plastics downstream.</p></li>
<li><p>We also want the plastic, if we can stop it from floating onward, to
be “accessible” and be easily gathered from the stream.</p></li>
<li><p>So a simple dam or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir" title="Weir on Wikipedia"><strong>weir-like</strong></a>
structure, or a net could work, but would possibly ruin our sense of
beauty. For example, we could consider stopping the flow of water in
places with weirs, but then that could make the location ugly and be
a hindrance to recreation and transportation. The presence of
plastics in the water could also alter the colour of the water.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we are interested in preserving dissolved oxygen in the
water. We want to prevent <em>other organic decaying material</em>
accumulating around the plastic and increasing the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/biological-oxygen-demand-bod-and-water" title="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/biological-oxygen-demand-bod-and-water"><strong>Biological
Oxygen
Demand</strong></a><strong>.</strong>
Not to mention the smell.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So many problems !!</p>
<p>With all this discussion, we can state at least one of our Problems as
an <a href="https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp" title="https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp"><strong>Administrative
Contradiction(AC)</strong></a>
in <em>plain English</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<strong>AC</strong>: We wish to pull out plastics from the <strong>river</strong>
without interrupting other human activities (economic / recreational /
transportation )
</center>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa
Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ <em>Ideal Final Result</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<strong>IFR</strong>:The River must flow. The Plastics must not.
</center>
</blockquote>
<p>Short and pithy.</p>
<p>We could do alternative Problem Definitions too, depending upon what our
focus was. (Our focus here is the <strong>river)</strong>. The way we would look at
the Parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram would be different in each case.
More on this in just a bit!</p>
<p>Let us take our AC and convert it into a <em>Technical Contradiction(TC)</em>,
keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the <em>48 TRIZ Parameters</em> in
the <a href="/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf"><strong>TRIZ</strong></a><a href="/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf" title="Download PDF of TRIZ Contradiction Matrix 2003"><strong>Contradiction</strong></a><a href="/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf"><strong>Matrix</strong>
<strong>(PDF)</strong></a> and see which
Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what
we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- TC 1</strong>: Increase <code>Volume of Stationary Object</code>(8) and not worsen
<code>Harmful effects acting on the system</code>(40)</p>
<p><strong>- TC 2</strong>: Improve <code>Harmful effects acting on the system</code>(40) and not
worsen <code>Volume of Stationary Object</code>(8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we choose these Parameters based on our IFR, which also reflects
that we choose the make the <strong>river</strong> our focus. We want to increase the
<code>volume</code> of the stationary plastic <strong>in the river</strong>, while not worsening
the <code>harmful effects</code> acting on the <strong>river</strong>. Note how the IFR is
included here, in using the word <strong>stationary</strong> for the object: the
plastic must <strong>not</strong> flow, while the river <strong>must</strong>.</p>
<p>As stated in my previous articles ( <a href="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/" title="Lawrence of Arabia: A TRIZ Analysis"><strong>Lawrence of
Arabia</strong></a>
and
<a href="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2023-01-09-triz-spotify/" title="TRIZ Analysis of a Recent Spotify Ad"><strong>Spotify</strong></a>),
there is considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative
interpretations of the AC, using the <em>language of TRIZ</em>, the <strong>48
Parameters</strong> in the Contradiction Matrix. Parameters chosen from the
TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as <em>metaphors</em> for the knobs that lie
within our AC; Going from the AC to the TC is an act of <em>making
metaphors</em>. We could easily have chosen the Parameter
<code>Amount of Substance (10)</code> i.e. the plastic <em>on the river</em>, as the
“metaphoric thing” to improve but the current IFR speaks of the
<strong>river</strong>. Or we could choose <code>Aesthetics and Appearance (39)</code> as our
target, leading to different solutions perhaps, but in a focussed
manner. TRIZ tends to <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/kahneman/files/attention_hi_quality.pdf" title="Daniel Kahneman"><strong>focus our
attention</strong></a>
like no other method that I know of.</p>
<p>We could also formulate a <em>Physical Contradiction(PC)</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<strong>PC</strong>: The Plastic must be in the River and not in the River
at the same time.
</center>
</blockquote>
<p>which is aimed at the river, as with the IFR. Again, if the IFR is
formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and
PC.</p>
</div>
<div id="solving-the-technical-contradiction" class="section level2">
<h2>Solving the Technical Contradiction</h2>
<p>Let us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive
at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution
for <code>TC-1</code> in the figure below; The square for solutions to <code>TC-1</code> has
been circled in red.</p>
<p><img src="matrix.png" /></p>
<p>Here is what the Matrix suggests:</p>
<p>For <code>TC-1</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>39(Inert Atmosphere)</p></li>
<li><p>24(Intermediary)</p></li>
<li><p>19(Periodic Action)</p></li>
<li><p>27(Cheap Short-Living Objects) (<strong>!!</strong>)</p>
<p>and with <code>TC-2</code>:</p></li>
<li><p>5(Merging)</p></li>
<li><p>17(Another Dimension)</p></li>
<li><p><del>39(Inert Atmosphere)</del></p></li>
<li><p><del>19(Periodic Action)</del></p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is neat list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some these
Inventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we
<em>Generalized Solutions</em> we try to map these back into the Problem at
hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(39)Inert Atmosphere</strong>: Hmm…what can be inert in the River? What
could “inert” mean here? The River should be inert…so must not
flow! OK, so a place where it must be still, perhaps!!</li>
<li><strong>24(Intermediary)</strong>: OK, something between the River and the
Plastic. But…we don’t want nets or dams or weirs…then what? Need
to think!!</li>
<li><strong>19(Periodic Action)</strong>: What can be “periodic” in the River? Waves?
But how do we <strong>make</strong> waves? Need to think some more!!</li>
<li><strong>27(Cheap Short Living Objects)</strong>: What can be cheap short and
short living in the River water? Not fish, surely…wait,
<strong>BUBBLES</strong>!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>So (breathlessly): we create bubbles in the water and use them as an
<em>Intermediary</em> to create waves/barriers that nudge the Plastic where we
want it it to be, for collection. And of course bubbles are both <em>Inert</em>
<strong>and</strong> <em>Atmosphere</em>, literally! And they are <em>Cheap</em> and <em>Short-Lived</em>
so we need to regenerate them <em>Periodically!</em> We can periodically
<em>sweep</em> the river with a broom made of bubbles and not seriously disturb
any other activity. Waah TRIZ, waah!</p>
<p><strong>5(Merging)</strong> is quite easy to interpret now, in retrospect.
<strong>17(Another Dimension)</strong> is also evocative and powerful as a Solution:
the River flows <strong>horizontally</strong> but the barrier we need to create is
<strong>vertical</strong>. Yet another interpretation could be that the Bubbles
<strong>dissolve in the River water</strong> (assuming <strong>another dimension,</strong> as it
were) and give us the benefit of purifying the water too, as fountains
do!!</p>
<p>So there you have it! It seems that <a href="https://thegreatbubblebarrier.com/" title="The Great Bubble Barrier"><strong>Going
Dutch</strong></a>
even with bubbles, is a good idea !</p>
</div>
<div id="using-triz-separation-principles" class="section level2">
<h2>Using TRIZ Separation Principles</h2>
<p>As Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying <strong>physical</strong>
parameter, such as <em>length</em>, <em>breadth</em>, <em>weight</em>, or <em>energy, or speed</em>
for example that lies at the root of our <em>Technical Contradiction</em>.</p>
<p>Our IFR states that we want the Plastics to not flow, and the River to
flow at the same time. But the Plastics are
<a href="https://christophertyler.org/CWTyler/AlicePDFs/13treacle.pdf" title="The Treacle Well ( Alice in Wonderland )"><strong>in</strong></a>
the River! This is a sort of a Physical Contradiction!</p>
<p>Can we make the River “less of a River” in places? Can we make
<strong>separate</strong> zones in the River that flow and not flow, and allow us to
harvest the plastic?Indeed,our Inventive Principles such as <strong>(39)Inert
Atmosphere</strong> and <strong>24(Intermediary)</strong> suggest such a “spatial”
separation. So we are applying SEPARATION in SPACE here, to solve a
Physical Contradiction related to “time”. TRIZ offers us a smaller and
more easily “memorizable” set of metaphoric solutions in the form of
<strong>Separation Principles</strong>. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="smallcaps">Separation in Time</span></li>
<li><span class="smallcaps">Separation in Space</span></li>
<li><span class="smallcaps">Separation on Condition</span></li>
<li><span class="smallcaps">Separation between Parts and the Whole</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while these <em>Separation Principles</em> are just a handful to
memorize, they are in my opinion, a little harder to apply straightway.
But then practice would help us. Note that all the Inventive Principles
in the Matrix can be, and have been, classified as to whether they hew
to a particular kind of <em>Separation</em> <em>Principle.</em></p>
<p>If there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ,
please send me a DM! Thanks !</p>
