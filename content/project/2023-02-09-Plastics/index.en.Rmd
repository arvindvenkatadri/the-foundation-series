# Introduction

Here we go with another of my *TRIZ Chronicles* ! The earlier editions
are here: [**Lawrence of
Arabia**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ "https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/")

This is another piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative
Thinking and Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*,

# Rivers of Plastic

According to [**Our World in
Data**](https://ourworldindata.org/ocean-plastics "Our World in Data")**:**

Previous research suggested that only a handful of rivers transports
almost all of the plastic to the sea -- new research suggests this is
not the case.

![](plastic-rivers.png)

> 80% of the world's ocean plastics enter the ocean via rivers and
> coastlines. The other 20% come from marine sources such as fishing

So the problem is more widespread **at source** and therefore
distributed local solutions are needed.

# So, Is there a Solution?

It seems we need to prevent plastics entering the oceans, by preventing
their flow in our rivers and streams, effectively dealing with the
problem *at source*. And that such a solution needs to be in widespread
use ( \>1600 rivers ) in order for it to be successful. So it needs to
be simple, effective and not terribly costly.

It seems that the beautiful city of Amsterdam, with its lovely canals,
has a solution already!

In the following, we will analyze this solution from a TRIZ standpoint.
We will construct **Contradictions**, specify the **Ideal Final
Result**, and find solutions using the **Contradiction Matrix**. We will
then interpret and apply the **Inventive Principles** suggested by the
matrix into the problem and show how the video above can be depicted as
yet another TRIZ solution! We will also very briefly foray into using
another aspect of TRIZ, namely the **Separation Principles** this time.

## A TRIZ Analysis of the Amsterdam Bubble Barrier

For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as
[**before**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ "https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"):

-   First, using the method described in [**Open Source
    TRIZ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k "Open Source TRIZ on YouTube")**,**
    we identify *knobs* or *parameters* within the situation

-   We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /
    Cause for a Problem in the form of a *Contradiction*.

-   Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and
    look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive
    Principles.

-   Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.

    ![](TRIZ.png){width="331"}

Here below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify the
*Parameters* of this Problem:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Cause and Effect Diagram or Fish- bone Sample
library(qcc)
library(SixSigma)

#Effect
effect <- "Plastics in Water"

#Causes
causes.head <- c("Measurement", "Material", "Methods", "Environment", "Manpower", "Machines")

#Individual Causes
causes <- vector(mode =  "list", length = length(causes.head))
causes[1] <- list(c("Smaller Quantities", "Smaller Area of Water", "Rate of Flow", "Width of the Stream", "Colour of Water"))

causes[2] <- list(c("Water", "Plastics","River Banks", "Air Flow", "Water Flow", "Sunlight", "Time"))

causes[3] <- list(c("Floating", "Being Visible", "Flowing", "Stopping", "Human Recreation Activities", "Fishing", "Transportation"))

causes[4] <- list(c("Stream","Riverbank Properties", "Bridges", "Weirs"))

causes[5] <- list(c("Humans","Fisherfolk", "Boat Operators"))
causes[6] <- list(c("Filters", "Nets", "Boats"))

#Fishbone Diagram
#
ss.ceDiag(effect,causes.head,causes, main ="~Smoke~ Plastics on the Water",ss.col = c("", "red"), sub = paste("Ishikawa Cause-Effect Diagram \n (Made with R)"))



```

Each of the above terms in the Ishikawa can be a **knob** for us.
[**Turning the *knobs/parameters* in the Ishikawa
Diagram**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k "Open Source TRIZ on Youtube"),
we try to improve a certain Parameter or we try to reduce its effect. In
doing so we could construct several alternative **Problem
Descriptions**. ( Of course not all Parameters may be accessible in a
given situation )

-   We want to deal with the (hopefully) smaller quantities of plastic
    closer to source, rather than the much larger quantities as we get
    nearer and into the high seas.

-   Clearly we want the rivers to flow and give us our sense of
    [**beauty, serenity and movement, and
    poetry**](https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/105/the-wind-in-the-willows/1795/the-open-road/ "The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame"),
    but the same flow should not transport plastics downstream.

-   We also want the plastic, if we can stop it from floating onward, to
    be "accessible" and be easily gathered from the stream.

-   So a simple dam or
    [**weir-like**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir "Weir on Wikipedia")
    structure, or a net could work, but would possibly ruin our sense of
    beauty. For example, we could consider stopping the flow of water in
    places with weirs, but then that could make the location ugly and be
    a hindrance to recreation and transportation. The presence of
    plastics in the water could also alter the colour of the water.

-   Finally, we are interested in preserving dissolved oxygen in the
    water. We want to prevent *other organic decaying material*
    accumulating around the plastic and increasing the [**Biological
    Oxygen
    Demand**](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/biological-oxygen-demand-bod-and-water "https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/biological-oxygen-demand-bod-and-water")**.**
    Not to mention the smell.

So many problems !!

With all this discussion, we can state at least one of our Problems as
an [**Administrative
Contradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp "https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp")
in *plain English*:

> <center>**AC**: We wish to pull out plastics from the **river**
> without interrupting other human activities (economic / recreational /
> transportation )</center>

Next, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa
Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ *Ideal Final Result*:

> <center>**IFR**:The River must flow. The Plastics must not.</center>

Short and pithy.

We could do alternative Problem Definitions too, depending upon what our
focus was. (Our focus here is the **river)**. The way we would look at
the Parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram would be different in each case.
More on this in just a bit!

Let us take our AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,
keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in
the [**TRIZ**
](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf)[**Contradiction**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf "Download PDF of TRIZ Contradiction Matrix 2003")[**Matrix**
**(PDF)**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see which
Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what
we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways[^2]:

> **- TC 1**: Increase `Volume of Stationary Object`(8) and not worsen
> `Harmful effects acting on the system`(40)
>
> **- TC 2**: Improve `Harmful effects acting on the system`(40) and not
> worsen `Volume of Stationary Object`(8)

Here we choose these Parameters based on our IFR, which also reflects
that we choose the make the **river** our focus. We want to increase the
`volume` of the stationary plastic **in the river**, while not worsening
the `harmful effects` acting on the **river**. Note how the IFR is
included here, in using the word **stationary** for the object: the
plastic must **not** flow, while the river **must**.

As stated in my previous articles ( [**Lawrence of
Arabia**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ "Lawrence of Arabia: A TRIZ Analysis")
and
[**Spotify**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2023-01-09-triz-spotify/ "TRIZ Analysis of a Recent Spotify Ad")),
there is considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative
interpretations of the AC, using the *language of TRIZ*, the **48
Parameters** in the Contradiction Matrix. Parameters chosen from the
TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as *metaphors* for the knobs that lie
within our AC; Going from the AC to the TC is an act of *making
metaphors*. We could easily have chosen the Parameter
`Amount of Substance (10)` i.e. the plastic *on the river*, as the
"metaphoric thing" to improve but the current IFR speaks of the
**river**. Or we could choose `Aesthetics and Appearance (39)` as our
target, leading to different solutions perhaps, but in a focussed
manner. TRIZ tends to [**focus our
attention**](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/kahneman/files/attention_hi_quality.pdf "Daniel Kahneman")
like no other method that I know of.

We could also formulate a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^3]:

> <center>**PC**: The Plastic must be in the River and not in the River
> at the same time.</center>

which is aimed at the river, as with the IFR. Again, if the IFR is
formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and
PC.

## Solving the Technical Contradiction

Let us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive
at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution
for `TC-1` in the figure below; The square for solutions to `TC-1` has
been circled in red.

![](matrix.png)

Here is what the Matrix suggests:

For `TC-1`:

1.  39(Inert Atmosphere)

2.  24(Intermediary)

3.  19(Periodic Action)

4.  27(Cheap Short-Living Objects) (**!!**)

    and with `TC-2`:

5.  5(Merging)

6.  17(Another Dimension)

7.  ~~39(Inert Atmosphere)~~

8.  ~~19(Periodic Action)~~

This is neat list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some these
Inventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we
*Generalized Solutions* we try to map these back into the Problem at
hand:

-   **(39)Inert Atmosphere**: Hmm...what can be inert in the River? What
    could "inert" mean here? The River should be inert...so must not
    flow! OK, so a place where it must be still, perhaps!!
-   **24(Intermediary)**: OK, something between the River and the
    Plastic. But...we don't want nets or dams or weirs...then what? Need
    to think!!
-   **19(Periodic Action)**: What can be "periodic" in the River? Waves?
    But how do we **make** waves? Need to think some more!!
-   **27(Cheap Short Living Objects)**: What can be cheap short and
    short living in the River water? Not fish, surely...wait,
    **BUBBLES**!!!

So (breathlessly): we create bubbles in the water and use them as an
*Intermediary* to create waves/barriers that nudge the Plastic where we
want it it to be, for collection. And of course bubbles are both *Inert*
**and** *Atmosphere*, literally! And they are *Cheap* and *Short-Lived*
so we need to regenerate them *Periodically!* We can periodically
*sweep* the river with a broom made of bubbles and not seriously disturb
any other activity. Waah TRIZ, waah!

**5(Merging)** is quite easy to interpret now, in retrospect.
**17(Another Dimension)** is also evocative and powerful as a Solution:
the River flows **horizontally** but the barrier we need to create is
**vertical**. Yet another interpretation could be that the Bubbles
**dissolve in the River water** (assuming **another dimension,** as it
were) and give us the benefit of purifying the water too, as fountains
do!!

So there you have it! It seems that [**Going
Dutch**](https://thegreatbubblebarrier.com/ "The Great Bubble Barrier")
even with bubbles, is a good idea !

## Using TRIZ Separation Principles

As Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying **physical**
parameter, such as *length*, *breadth*, *weight*, or *energy, or speed*
for example that lies at the root of our *Technical Contradiction*.

Our IFR states that we want the Plastics to not flow, and the River to
flow at the same time. But the Plastics are
[**in**](https://christophertyler.org/CWTyler/AlicePDFs/13treacle.pdf "The Treacle Well ( Alice in Wonderland )")
the River! This is a sort of a Physical Contradiction!

Can we make the River "less of a River" in places? Can we make
**separate** zones in the River that flow and not flow, and allow us to
harvest the plastic?Indeed,our Inventive Principles such as **(39)Inert
Atmosphere** and **24(Intermediary)** suggest such a "spatial"
separation. So we are applying SEPARATION in SPACE here, to solve a
Physical Contradiction related to "time". TRIZ offers us a smaller and
more easily "memorizable" set of metaphoric solutions in the form of
**Separation Principles**. Here they are:

-   [Separation in Time]{.smallcaps}
-   [Separation in Space]{.smallcaps}
-   [Separation on Condition]{.smallcaps}
-   [Separation between Parts and the Whole]{.smallcaps}

Note that while these *Separation Principles* are just a handful to
memorize, they are in my opinion, a little harder to apply straightway.
But then practice would help us. Note that all the Inventive Principles
in the Matrix can be, and have been, classified as to whether they hew
to a particular kind of *Separation* *Principle.*

If there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ,
please send me a DM! Thanks !
