## Introduction

This is an attempt to rework , using `tidygraph`  and `ggraph`, much of [**Network Visualization with R**](https://www.kateto.net/polnet2018) Polnet 2018 Workshop Tutorial, Washington, DC by Prof. Katherine (Katya) Ognyanova.

The aim is to get a working acquaintance with both these packages and also to appreciate some of the concepts in Networks. My code is by no means intended to be elegant; it merely works and there are surely many improvements that people may think of!

I have attempted to write code for the Sections 2:5. 

I have retained Prof. Ognyanova's text in all places.

## -------~~ DATASET 1: edgelist ~~-------

```{r}
# Read in the data:
nodes <- read.csv("./Dataset1-Media-Example-NODES.csv", header = T, as.is = T)
links <- read.csv("./Dataset1-Media-Example-EDGES.csv", header = T, as.is = T)
```

```{r}
# Examine the data:
head(nodes)
head(links)
```

### Converting the data to an igraph object:
The `graph_from_data_frame()` function takes two data frames: 'd' and 'vertices'.
- 'd' describes the edges of the network - it should start with two columns containing the source and target node IDs for each network tie.
- 'vertices' should start with a column of node IDs. It can be omitted.
- Any additional columns in either data frame are interpreted as attributes.

NOTE: ID columns need not be numbers or integers!!

```{r}
net <- graph_from_data_frame(d = links, vertices = nodes, directed = T)

# Examine the resulting object:
class(net)
net
```

 The description of an igraph object starts with four letters:
    -D or U, for a directed or undirected graph
    -N for a named graph (where nodes have a `name` attribute)
    -W for a weighted graph (where edges have a `weight` attribute)
    -B for a bipartite (two-mode) graph (where nodes have a `type` attribute)
 The two numbers that follow (17 49) refer to the **number of nodes** and **edges** in the graph. The description also lists node & edge attributes.

We can access the nodes, edges, and their attributes:

```{r}
E(net)
V(net)
E(net)$type
V(net)$media
```


```{r}
# Using tidygraph
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  select(type)
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  select(media)

```
 
Or find specific nodes and edges by attribute:(that returns objects of type vertex sequence / edge sequence)

```{r}
V(net)[media == "BBC"]
E(net)[type == "mention"]

```

```{r}
#Using tidygraph
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  filter(media == "BBC")
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(type == "mention")

```

If you need them, you can extract an edge list or a matrix back from the igraph networks.

```{r}
as_edgelist(net, names = T)
as_adjacency_matrix(net, attr = "weight")

# Using tidygraph
# No direct command seems available ...

```


```{r}
# Or data frames describing nodes and edges:
igraph::as_data_frame(x = net, what = "edges")
igraph::as_data_frame(x = net, what = "vertices")

#Using tidygraph
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  as_tibble()
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE)%>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  as_tibble()

```

```{r}
# You can also access the network matrix directly:
net[1,]
net[5,7]

# Using tidygraph
# Does not seem possible, even with `as.matrix()`.
# Returns tibbles only as in the code chunk above
```


```{r}
# First attempt to plot the graph:
plot(net) # not pretty!


# Removing loops from the graph:
net <-
  igraph::simplify(net, remove.multiple = F, remove.loops = T)

# Let's and reduce the arrow size and remove the labels:
plot(net, edge.arrow.size = .4, vertex.label = NA)
```



```{r}
# Using tidygraph
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>%
  ggraph(., layout = "graphopt") +
  geom_edge_link(
    color = "grey",
    end_cap = circle(0.2, "cm"),
    start_cap = circle(0.2, "cm"),
    # clears an area near the node
    
    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "last",
      length = unit(3, "mm")
    )
  ) +
  geom_node_point(size = 6, shape = 21, fill = "orange") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id))

# Removing loops from the graph:
# From the docs:
# convert() is a shorthand for performing both `morph` and `crystallise` along with extracting a single tbl_graph (defaults to the first). For morphs w(h)ere you know they only create a single graph, and you want to keep it, this is an easy way.
#
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>%

  convert(to_simple) %>%
  ggraph(., layout = "graphopt") +
  geom_edge_link(
    color = "grey",
    end_cap = circle(0.2, "cm"),
    start_cap = circle(0.2, "cm"),
 
    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "last",
      length = unit(3, "mm")
    )
  ) +
  geom_node_point(size = 6, shape = 21, fill = "orange")

```



## -------~~ DATASET 2: matrix  --------

```{r}
# Read in the data:
nodes2 <- read.csv("./Dataset2-Media-User-Example-NODES.csv", header = T, as.is = T)
links2 <- read.csv("./Dataset2-Media-User-Example-EDGES.csv", header = T, row.names = 1)

# Examine the data:
head(nodes2)
head(links2)

# links2 is a matrix for a two-mode network:
links2 <- as.matrix(links2)
dim(links2)
dim(nodes2)

```

Note: What is a **two-mode** network? A network that as a `node$type` variable and can be a `bipartite` or a `k-partite` network as a result. 

```{r}
# Create an igraph network object from the two-mode matrix:
net2 <- igraph::graph_from_incidence_matrix(links2)

# To transform a one-mode network matrix into an igraph object,
# we would use graph_from_adjacency_matrix()

# A built-in vertex attribute 'type' shows which mode vertices belong to.
table(V(net2)$type)
# Basic igraph plot
plot(net2,vertex.label = NA)
```



```{r}
# using tidygraph
# For all objects that are not node and edge data_frames
# tidygraph uses `as_tbl_graph()`
# 
graph <- as_tbl_graph(links2)
graph %>% activate(nodes) %>% as_tibble()
graph %>% activate(edges) %>% as_tibble()

graph %>% 
  ggraph(., layout = "graphopt") + 
  geom_edge_link(color = "grey") + 
  geom_node_point(fill = "orange", 
                  shape = 21, size = 6, 
                  color = "black")
```

```{r}
# Examine the resulting object:
class(net2)
net2
```

Note: The remaining attributes for the nodes  ( in data frame `nodes2`) are not (yet) a part of the graph, either with igraph or with tidygraph.



# 3. Network plots in 'igraph'



##  ------~~ Plot parameters in igraph --------

Check out the node options (starting with 'vertex.') and the edge options  (starting with 'edge.').

```{r}
?igraph.plotting
```
 
We can set the node & edge options in two ways - one is to specify them in the `plot()` function, as we are doing below.


- Plot with curved edges (edge.curved = .1) and reduce arrow size:

```{r}
plot(net, edge.arrow.size = .4, edge.curved = .1)

# Using tidygraph
graph <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE)
graph
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = "graphopt") +
  geom_edge_arc(
    color = "grey",
    strength = 0.1,
    end_cap = circle(.2, "cm"),

    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "both",
      length = unit(3, "mm")
    )
  ) +
  geom_node_point(
    fill = "orange",
    shape = 21,
    size = 8,
    color = "black"
  ) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id))
```

- Set node color to orange and the border color to hex 555555
- Replace the vertex label with the node names stored in "media"

```{r}
plot(
  net,
  edge.arrow.size = .2,
  edge.curved = 0,
  vertex.color = "orange",
  vertex.frame.color = "#555555",
  vertex.label = V(net)$media,
  vertex.label.color = "black",
  vertex.label.cex = .7
)

# Using tidygraph
#graph <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE)
#graph
graph %>%
  ggraph(., layout = "gem") +
  geom_edge_link(
    color = "grey",
    end_cap = circle(.3, "cm"),
    
    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "both",
      length = unit(1, "mm")
    )
  ) +
  geom_node_point(
    fill = "orange",
    shape = 21,
    size = 6,
    color = "#555555"
  ) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = media))

```



The second way to set attributes is to **add them** to the igraph object.

- Generate colors based on media type:
```{r}
colrs <- c("gray50", "tomato", "gold")
V(net)$color <- colrs[V(net)$media.type]
plot(net)
```


- Compute node degrees (#links) and use that to set node size:

```{r}
deg <- igraph::degree(net, mode = "all")
V(net)$size <- deg*3
# Alternatively, we can set node size based on audience size:
V(net)$size <- V(net)$audience.size*0.7
V(net)$size
# The labels are currently node IDs.
# Setting them to NA will render no labels:
V(net)$label.color <- "black"
V(net)$label <- NA

# Set edge width based on weight:
E(net)$width <- E(net)$weight/6

#change arrow size and edge color:
E(net)$arrow.size <- .2
E(net)$edge.color <- "gray80"

# We can even set the network layout:
graph_attr(net, "layout") <- layout_with_lgl
plot(net)
```

```{r}


# Using tidygraph
# graph <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE)
# graph
graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>%
  ggraph(., layout = "lgl") +
  geom_edge_link(
    aes(width = weight),
    color = "grey80",
    end_cap = circle(.2, "cm"),
    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "last",
      length = unit(1, "mm")
    )
  ) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = type.label, size = size),
                  shape = 21,
                  color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Media Type",
                    values = c("grey50", "gold", "tomato")) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1.5), guide = "none") +
  scale_size_continuous("Degree", range =  c(2, 16)) +
  
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Media Type",
                             override.aes = list(pch = 21, size = 4)))

```

We can also override the attributes explicitly in the plot:

```{r}
plot(net, edge.color = "orange", vertex.color = "gray50")
```

We can also add a legend explaining the meaning of the colors we used:

```{r}
plot(net)
legend(x = -2.1, y = -1.1, 
       c("Newspaper","Television", "Online News"), 
       pch = 21,col = "#777777", 
       pt.bg = colrs, pt.cex = 2.5, bty = "n", ncol = 1)

# legends are automatic with the tidygraph + ggraph flow
```

Sometimes, especially with semantic networks, we may be interested in plotting only the labels of the nodes:

```{r}
plot(net, vertex.shape = "none", vertex.label = V(net)$media,
     vertex.label.font = 2, vertex.label.color = "gray40",
     vertex.label.cex = .7, edge.color = "gray85")


#using tidygraph

ggraph(net, layout = "gem") +
  geom_edge_link(color = "grey80", width = 2,
                 end_cap = circle(0.5,"cm"), 
                 start_cap = circle(0.5, "cm")) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = media))
```

Let's color the edges of the graph based on their source node color. We'll get the starting node for each edge with `ends()`.

Note: Edge attribute is being set by start node. 

```{r}
edge.start <- ends(net, es = E(net), names = F)[,1]
edge.col <- V(net)$color[edge.start] # How simple this is !!!
# The three colors are recycled 
# 
plot(net, edge.color = edge.col, edge.curved = .4)

```

NOTE: The source node colour has been set using the `media.type`, which is a node attribute. Node attributes are not typically accessible to edges. So we need to build a combo data frame using `dplyr`, so that edges can use this node attribute. ( There may be other ways...)

```{r}
# Using tidygraph
# Make a "combo" data frame of nodes *and* edges with left_join()
# Join by `from` so that type.label is based on from = edge.start

links %>%
  left_join(., nodes, by = c("from" = "id")) %>%
  tbl_graph(edges = ., nodes = nodes) %>%
  
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>%
  
  ggraph(., layout = "lgl") +
  geom_edge_arc(aes(color = type.label,
                    width = weight),
                strength = 0.3)  +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = type.label,
                      # type.label is now available as edge attribute
                      size = size),
                  shape = 21,
                  color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Media Type",
    values = c("grey50", "gold", "tomato"),
    guide = "legend"
  ) +
  scale_edge_color_manual(name = "Source Type",
                          values = c("grey80", "gold", "tomato")) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1.5), guide = "none") +
  scale_size_continuous("Degree", range =  c(2, 16)) +
  # not "limits"!
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(pch = 21,
                                                 size = 4)))
```



## -------~~ Network Layouts in 'igraph' --------

Network layouts are algorithms that return **coordinates** for each node in a network.

Let's generate a slightly larger 100-node graph using a `preferential attachment` model (Barabasi-Albert).

```{r}
net.bg <- sample_pa(n =  100, power =  1.2)
V(net.bg)$size <- 8
V(net.bg)$frame.color <- "white"
V(net.bg)$color <- "orange"
V(net.bg)$label <- ""
E(net.bg)$arrow.mode <- 0
plot(net.bg)

# Using tidygraph
graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>%
  ggraph(., layout = "graphopt") +
  geom_edge_link(color = "grey") +
  geom_node_point(color = "orange", size = 4) +
  theme_graph()

```


Now let's plot this network using the layouts available in igraph. You can set the layout in the plot function:

```{r}
plot(net.bg, layout = layout_randomly)
```

Or calculate the vertex coordinates in advance:

```{r}
l <- layout_in_circle(net.bg)
plot(net.bg, layout = l)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = "circle") +
  geom_edge_link(color = "grey") +
  geom_node_point(color = "orange", size = 2) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

`l` is simply a matrix of x,y coordinates (N x 2) for the N nodes in the graph. You can generate your own:

```{r}
l
l <- cbind(1:vcount(net.bg), c(1, vcount(net.bg):2))
plot(net.bg, layout = l)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = l) +
  geom_edge_link(color = "grey") +
  geom_node_point(color = "orange", size = 2)+
  theme_graph()
```


This layout is just an example and not very helpful - thankfully `igraph` has a number of built-in layouts, including:

- Randomly placed vertices
```{r}
l <- layout_randomly(net.bg)
plot(net.bg, layout = l)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_randomly(.)) + 
  geom_edge_link0(colour = "grey") + 
  geom_node_point(colour = "orange", size = 4)

```

- Circle layout
```{r}
l <- layout_in_circle(net.bg)
plot(net.bg, layout = l)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_in_circle(.)) + 
  geom_edge_link0(colour = "grey") + 
  geom_node_point(colour = "orange") +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

- 3D sphere layout
```{r}
l <- layout_on_sphere(net.bg)
plot(net.bg, layout = l)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_on_sphere(.)) + 
  geom_edge_link0(colour = "grey") + 
  geom_node_point(colour = "orange")
```
- The Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm: 
Nice but slow, most often used in graphs smaller than ~1000 vertices.
```{r}
l <- layout_with_fr(net.bg)
plot(net.bg, layout = l)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_fr(.)) + 
  geom_edge_link0(colour = "grey") + 
  geom_node_point(colour = "orange")
```

You will also notice that the F-R layout is not deterministic - different runs will result in slightly different configurations. Saving the layout in l allows us to get the exact same result multiple times.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(1,1,1,1))
plot(net.bg, layout = layout_with_fr)
plot(net.bg, layout = layout_with_fr)
plot(net.bg, layout = l)
plot(net.bg, layout = l)

```


By default, the coordinates of the plots are rescaled to the [-1,1] interval for both x and y. You can change that with the parameter `rescale = FALSE` and rescale your plot manually by multiplying the coordinates by a scalar. You can use `norm_coords` to normalize the plot with the boundaries you want. This way you can create more compact or spread out layout versions.

```{r}
#Get the layout coordinates:
l <- layout_with_fr(net.bg)
# Normalize them so that they are in the -1, 1 interval:
l <- norm_coords(l, ymin = -1, ymax = 1, xmin = -1, xmax = 1)

par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*0.4)
plot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*0.8)
plot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*1.2)
plot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*1.6)

# Using tidygraph
# Can't do this with tidygraph ( multiplying layout * scalar ), it seems

```

Another popular force-directed algorithm that produces nice results for connected graphs is **Kamada Kawai**. Like Fruchterman Reingold, it attempts to minimize the energy in a spring system.

```{r}
l <- layout_with_kk(net.bg)
plot(net.bg, layout = l)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_kk(.)) + 
  geom_edge_link0(colour = "grey") + 
  geom_node_point(colour = "orange", size = 4)
```

The **MDS (multidimensional scaling)** algorithm tries to place nodes based on some measure of similarity or distance between them. More similar/less distant nodes are placed closer to each other. By default, the measure used is based on the shortest paths between nodes in the network. That can be changed with the `dist` parameter.

```{r}
plot(net.bg, layout = layout_with_mds)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_mds(.)) + 
  geom_edge_link0(colour = "grey") + 
  geom_node_point(colour = "orange", size = 4)
```

The LGL algorithm is for large connected graphs. Here you can specify a `root`- the node that will be placed in the middle of the layout.

```{r}
plot(net.bg, layout = layout_with_lgl)

# Using tidygraph
# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)
graph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_lgl(.)) + 
  geom_edge_link0(colour = "grey") + 
  geom_node_point(colour = "orange", size = 4)
```

By default, igraph uses a layout called `layout_nicely` which selects an appropriate layout algorithm based on the properties of the graph. Check out all available layouts in igraph:

```{r}
?igraph::layout_
```


```{r}
layouts <- grep("^layout_", ls("package:igraph"), value = TRUE)[-1]

# Remove layouts that do not apply to our graph.
layouts <- layouts[!grepl("bipartite|merge|norm|sugiyama|tree", layouts)]

par(mfrow = c(3,3), mar = c(1,1,1,1))

for (layout in layouts) {
  print(layout)
  l <- do.call(layout, list(net))
  plot(net, edge.arrow.mode = 0, layout = l, main = layout) }
```




# -------~~ Highlighting aspects of the network --------

```{r}
plot(net)
```

Notice that our network plot is still not too helpful. We can identify the type and size of nodes, but cannot see much about the structure since the links we're examining are so dense. One way to approach this is to see if we can sparsify the network.

```{r}
hist(links$weight)
mean(links$weight)
sd(links$weight)
```

There are more sophisticated ways to extract the key edges, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll only keep ones that have weight higher than the mean for the network. We can delete edges using `delete_edges(net, edges)` (or, by the way, add edges with `add_edges(net, edges)` )

```{r}
cut.off <- mean(links$weight)
net.sp <- delete_edges(net, E(net)[weight<cut.off])
plot(net.sp, layout = layout_with_kk)

# Using tidygraph
graph <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) 
graph
graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>%
  
  # New stuff here
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(weight >= mean(weight)) %>% 
  
  ggraph(., layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link(
    aes(width = weight),
    color = "grey80",
    end_cap = circle(.2, "cm"),
    
    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "last",
      length = unit(1, "mm")
    )) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = type.label,
                      size = size),
                  shape = 21,
                  color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Media Type",
    values = c("grey50", "gold", "tomato"),
    guide = "legend") +
  
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1.5), guide = "none") +
  scale_size_continuous("Degree", range =  c(2, 16)) +
  # not "limits"!
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(pch = 21,
                                                 size = 4)))
  
```

Another way to think about this is to plot the two tie types (hyperlinks and mentions) separately. We will do that in section 5 of this tutorial: Plotting multiplex networks.
 
### Community Detection

We can also try to make the network map more useful by showing the communities within it.

```{r}
#Community detection (by optimizing modularity over partitions):
clp <- cluster_optimal(net)
class(clp)
clp
clp$membership

```

Community detection returns an object of class "communities" which igraph knows how to plot:

```{r}
plot(clp, net)
```


To plot communities using the `tidygraph` approach, I have taken help from the `ggforce` package. This package allows drawing of hull shapes around specific sets of points. Here goes:

```{r}
# Using tidygraph
# And ggforce
library(ggforce)
graph <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) 
graph <- graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>%
  # new stuff
  mutate(community = as.factor(tidygraph::group_optimal()))

# Need to pre-compute layout coordinates to pass to ggforce
# To create a hull around each community
layout_go <- layout_with_graphopt(graph)
  
ggraph(graph, layout = layout_go) +
  
 # new stuff
 # need to pass x and y coordinates of nodes to `geom_mark_hull`
 # Hull colour is `community`
 #
  ggforce::geom_mark_hull(aes(x = layout_go[, 1],
                     y = layout_go[, 2],
                     color = community)) +
  
  geom_edge_link(
    aes(width = weight),
    color = "grey80",
    end_cap = circle(.2, "cm"),
    
    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "last",
      length = unit(1, "mm")
    )
  ) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = type.label,
                      size = size),
                  shape = 21,
                  color = "black") +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1.5), guide = "none") +
  scale_size_continuous("Degree", range =  c(2, 10)) +
  scale_fill_discrete("Media Type") +
  scale_colour_discrete("Community") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(pch = 21,
                                                 size = 4)))

```

We can also plot the communities without relying on their built-in plot:

```{r}
V(net)$community <- clp$membership
colrs <-
  adjustcolor(c("gray50", "tomato", "gold", "yellowgreen"), alpha = .6)
plot(net, vertex.color = colrs[V(net)$community])


# using tidygraph
# All clustering algorithms from igraph is available in tidygraph using the group_* prefix. All of these functions return an integer vector with nodes (or edges) sharing the same integer being grouped together.
graph <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) 
graph
graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>%
  
  # new stuff
  mutate(community = as.factor(tidygraph::group_optimal())) %>% 
  
  ggraph(., layout = "graphopt") +
  geom_edge_link(
    aes(width = weight),
    color = "grey80",
    end_cap = circle(.2, "cm"),
    # clears an area near the node
    
    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "last",
      length = unit(1, "mm")
    )) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = community,
                      size = size),
                  shape = 21,
                  color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Community",
    values = c("grey50", "gold", "tomato", "yellowgreen"),
    guide = "legend") +

  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1.5), guide = "none") +
  scale_size_continuous("Degree", range =  c(2, 10)) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(pch = 21,
                                                 size = 4)))

```


## -------~~ Highlighting specific nodes or links --------


Sometimes we want to focus the visualization on a particular node or a group of nodes. Let's represent distance from the NYT:
 
 - `distances()` calculates shortest path from vertices in 'v' to ones in 'to'.
 
```{r}
dist.from.NYT <- distances(net, 
                           v = V(net)[media == "NY Times"], 
                           to = V(net), 
                           weights = NA)

#Set colors to plot the distances:
oranges <- colorRampPalette(c("dark red", "gold"))
col <- oranges(max(dist.from.NYT)+1)
col <- col[dist.from.NYT+1]

# Let's have same coordinates for Nodes in both graph renderings
# Then we can verify that the distance calculations are the same for both renderings
coords <- igraph::layout_nicely(net)
plot(net, vertex.label = dist.from.NYT,
     vertex.color = col, vertex.label.color = "black",
     layout = coords)

```


```{r}
# Using tidygraph
graph <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE)
graph

# Set up NY Times as root node first
# V(net)[media == "NY Times"] cannot be used since it returns an `igraph.vs` ( i.e. a list ) object. 
# We need an integer node id.
root_nyt <- graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rowid_to_column(var = "node_id") %>%
  filter(media == "NY Times") %>%
  select(node_id) %>% as_vector()
root_nyt


graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>%
  
  # new stuff:
  # breadth first search for all distances from the root node
  mutate(order = bfs_dist(root = root_nyt)) %>%
  
  ggraph(., layout = coords) + # same layout
  geom_edge_link(
    aes(width = weight),
    color = "grey80",
    end_cap = circle(.2, "cm"),
    arrow = arrow(
      type = "closed",
      ends = "last",
      length = unit(1, "mm")
    )
  ) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = order,
                      size = size),
                  shape = 21,
                  color = "black") +
  
  geom_node_text(aes(label = order)) +
  
  scale_fill_gradient(
    name = "Distance from NY Times",
    low = "dark red",
    high = "gold",
    guide = "legend"
  ) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1.5), guide = "none") +
  scale_size_continuous("Degree", range =  c(2, 16)) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(pch = 21,
                                                 size = 4)))
```

Or, a bit more readable:
```{r}
plot(net, vertex.color = col, 
     vertex.label = dist.from.NYT, edge.arrow.size = .6,
     vertex.label.color = "white", 
     vertex.size = V(net)$size*1.6, 
     edge.width = 2,
     layout = norm_coords(layout_with_lgl(net))*1.4, rescale = F)
```


## Path Highlighting

We can also highlight paths between the nodes in the network.

- Say here between MSNBC and the New York Post

```{r}
news.path <- shortest_paths(net,
                            from  =  V(net)[media == "MSNBC"],
                            to   =  V(net)[media == "New York Post"],
                            output  =  "both")  #both path nodes and edges
news.path.distance <- distances(net,
                                V(net)[media == "MSNBC"],
                                V(net)[media == "New York Post"] )
news.path
news.path.distance

#Generate edge color variable to plot the path:
ecol <- rep("gray80", ecount(net))
ecol[unlist(news.path$epath)] <- "orange"

#Generate edge width variable to plot the path:
ew <- rep(2, ecount(net))
ew[unlist(news.path$epath)] <- 4

#Generate node color variable to plot the path:
vcol <- rep("gray40", vcount(net))
vcol[unlist(news.path$vpath)] <- "gold"

plot(net, vertex.color = vcol, 
     edge.color = ecol,
     edge.width = ew, 
     edge.arrow.mode = 0,
     ## added lines
     vertex.label = V(net)$media,
     vertex.label.font = 2, 
     vertex.label.color = "gray40",
     vertex.label.cex = .7,
     layout = coords * 1.5)
```



```{r}


# Using tidygraph
# We need to use:
# to_shortest_path(graph, from, to, mode = "out", weights = NULL)
# Let's set up `to` and `from` nodes
#
# V(net)[media == "NY Times"] cannot be used since it returns an `igraph.vs` ( i.e. a list ) object.
# We need integer node ids for `from` and `to` in `to_shortest_path`

msnbc <- graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rowid_to_column(var = "node_id") %>%
  filter(media == "MSNBC") %>%
  select(node_id) %>% as_vector()
msnbc
nypost <- graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rowid_to_column(var = "node_id") %>%
  filter(media == "New York Post") %>%
  select(node_id) %>% as_vector()
nypost

# Let's create a fresh graph object using morph
# However we want to merge it back with the original `graph`
# to get an overlay plot
#
# # Can do this to obtain a separate graph
# convert(to_shortest_path,from = msnbc,to = nypost)
# However we want to merge it back with the original `graph`
# to get an overlay plot
msnbc_nyp <-
  graph %>%
  # first mark all nodes and edges as *not* on the shortest path
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(shortest_path_node = FALSE) %>%
  activate(edges) %>%
  mutate(shortest_path_edge = FALSE) %>%
  
  # Find shortest path between MSNBC and NY Post
  morph(to_shortest_path, from = msnbc, to = nypost) %>%
  
  # Now to mark the shortest_path nodes as TRUE
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(shortest_path_node = TRUE) %>%
  
  # Now to mark the shortest_path edges as TRUE
  activate(edges) %>%
  mutate(shortest_path_edge = TRUE) %>%
  #
  # Merge back into main graph; Still saving it as a `msnbc_nyp`
  unmorph()
msnbc_nyp


msnbc_nyp %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>%
  ggraph(layout = coords) +
  #geom_edge_link0(colour = "grey") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(colour = shortest_path_edge,
                      width = shortest_path_edge)) +
  
  geom_node_point(aes(size = size,
                      fill = shortest_path_node), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = media)) +
  
  scale_size_continuous("Degree", range =  c(2, 16)) +
  scale_fill_manual("Shortest Path",
                    values = c("grey", "gold")) +
  
  scale_edge_width_manual(values = c(1, 4)) +
  
  scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("grey", "orange")) +
  guides(
    fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(pch = 21,
                                            size = 6)),
    edge_colour = "none",
    edge_width = "none"
  )

```


- Highlight the edges going into or out of a vertex, for instance the WSJ. For a single node, use `incident()`, for multiple nodes use `incident_edges()`

```{r}
inc.edges <-
  incident(net, V(net)[media == "Wall Street Journal"], mode = "all")

#Set colors to plot the selected edges.
ecol <- rep("gray80", ecount(net))
ecol[inc.edges] <- "orange"
vcol <- rep("grey40", vcount(net))
vcol[V(net)$media == "Wall Street Journal"] <- "gold"
plot(
  net,
  vertex.color = vcol,
  edge.color = ecol,
  edge.width = 2,
  layout = coords
)
```

```{r}
# Using tidygraph
wsj <- graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "node_id") %>% 
  filter(media == "Wall Street Journal") %>% 
  select(node_id) %>% as_vector()

graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(wsj_adjacent = node_is_adjacent(to = wsj, mode = "all", 
                                         include_to = TRUE),
         size = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  mutate(WSJ = if_else(media == "Wall Street Journal", TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(wsj_links = edge_is_incident(wsj)) %>% 
  
  ggraph(., layout = coords) +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(colour = wsj_links), width = 2) + 
  
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = WSJ, 
                      size = size),shape = 21) +
  
  geom_node_text(aes(label = media), repel = TRUE) + 
  
  scale_fill_manual("WSJ Neighbours", 
                      values = c("grey", "gold"), 
                      guide = guide_legend(override.aes = 
                                             list(pch = 21, 
                                                  size = 5))) + 
  scale_edge_colour_manual("WSJ Links", 
                      values = c("grey", "orange")) + 
  scale_size("Degree", range = c( 2, 16)) +
  ggtitle(label = "Highlighting WSJ Neighbours and Links") +
  guides(shape = "none", fill = "none" #, colour = "none"
  )
```


## Highlight Neighbours
Or we can highlight the immediate neighbors of a vertex, say WSJ. The `neighbors` function finds all nodes one step out from the focal actor. To find the neighbors for multiple nodes, use `adjacent_vertices()`. To find node neighborhoods going more than one step out, use function `ego()` with parameter `order` set to the number of steps out to go from the focal node(s).

```{r}
neigh.nodes <- neighbors(net, V(net)[media == "Wall Street Journal"], mode = "out")

# Set colors to plot the neighbors:
vcol[neigh.nodes] <- "#ff9d00"
plot(net, vertex.color = vcol)
```

```{r}
# Using tidygraph
wsj <- graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "node_id") %>% 
  filter(media == "Wall Street Journal") %>% 
  select(node_id) %>% as_vector()

graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(wsj_adjacent = node_is_adjacent(to = wsj, mode = "all", 
  # remove WSJ from the list!
  # highlight only the neighbours
  
                                         include_to = FALSE),
         size = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  mutate(WSJ = if_else(media == "Wall Street Journal", TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(wsj_links = edge_is_incident(wsj)) %>% 
  
  ggraph(., layout = coords) +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(colour = wsj_links), width = 2) + 
  
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = wsj_adjacent, 
                      size = size),shape = 21) +
  
  geom_node_text(aes(label = media), repel = TRUE) + 
  
  scale_fill_manual("WSJ Neighbours", 
                      values = c("grey", "gold"), 
                      guide = guide_legend(override.aes = 
                                             list(pch = 21, 
                                                  size = 5))) + 
  scale_edge_colour_manual("WSJ Links", 
                      values = c("grey", "orange")) + 
  scale_size("Degree", range = c( 2, 16)) +
  ggtitle(label = "Highlighting WSJ Neighbours and Links") +
  guides(shape = "none", fill = "none" #, colour = "none"
  )
```

Another way to draw attention to a group of nodes: (This is generally not recommended since, depending on layout, nodes that are not 'marked' can accidentally get placed on top of the mark)

```{r}
plot(net, mark.groups = c(1,4,5,8), mark.col = "#C5E5E7", mark.border = NA)
# Mark multiple groups:
plot(net, mark.groups = list(c(1,4,5,8), c(15:17)),
          mark.col = c("#C5E5E7","#ECD89A"), mark.border = NA)
```


## -------~~ Interactive plotting with 'tkplot' --------

R and igraph offer interactive plotting capabilities (mostly helpful for small networks)
```{r}
tkid <- tkplot(net) #tkid is the id of the tkplot

l <- tkplot.getcoords(tkid) # grab the coordinates from tkplot
plot(net, layout = l)
```


## -------~~ Other ways to represent a network --------

One reminder that there are other ways to represent a network:

- Heatmap of the network matrix:
```{r}
netm <- as_adjacency_matrix(net, attr = "weight", sparse = F)
colnames(netm) <- V(net)$media
rownames(netm) <- V(net)$media

palf <- colorRampPalette(c("gold", "dark orange"))

# The Rowv & Colv parameters turn dendrograms on and off
heatmap(netm[,17:1], Rowv  =  NA, Colv  =  NA, col  =  palf(20),
        scale = "none", margins = c(10,10) )
```


- Degree distribution
```{r}
deg.dist <- degree_distribution(net, cumulative = T, mode = "all")
# degree is available in `sna` too
plot(x = 0:max(igraph::degree(net)), y = 1-deg.dist, pch = 19, cex = 1.4, col = "orange", xlab = "Degree", ylab = "Cumulative Frequency")

# Using Tidygraph
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18356860/cumulative-histogram-with-ggplot2
graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = "all")) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = degree, y = stat(count))) +
  # geom_histogram(aes(y = cumsum(..count..)), binwidth = 1) + 
  stat_bin(aes(y = cumsum(..count..)),
                binwidth = 1,# Ta-Da !!
                geom ="point",color ="orange", size = 5)

```



## 4. Plotting two-mode networks

```{r}
head(nodes2)
head(links2)

net2
plot(net2)
```

This time we will make nodes look different based on their type. Media outlets are blue squares, audience nodes are orange circles:

```{r}
V(net2)$color <- c("steel blue", "orange")[V(net2)$type+1]
V(net2)$shape <- c("square", "circle")[V(net2)$type+1]

# Media outlets will have name labels, audience members will not:
V(net2)$label <- ""
V(net2)$label[V(net2)$type == F] <- nodes2$media[V(net2)$type == F]
V(net2)$label.cex = .6
V(net2)$label.font = 2

plot(net2, vertex.label.color = "white", vertex.size = (2-V(net2)$type)*8)

```




```{r}
# Using tidygraph
as_tbl_graph(x = links2, directed = TRUE) %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  left_join(nodes2, by = c("name" = "id")) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link0() +
  geom_node_point(aes(shape = type, fill = type, size = type)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = if_else(type, "", media)), colour = "white", size = 3) +
  
  scale_shape_manual(
    "Type",
    values = c(22, 21),
    labels = c("Media", "Persons"),
    guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 6))
  ) +
  
  scale_fill_manual(
    "Type",
    values = c("dodgerblue", "orange"),
    labels = c("Media", "Persons")
  ) +
  
  scale_size_manual(values = c(10, 4), guide = "none") 

```


`igraph` has a built-in bipartite layout, though it's not the most helpful:

```{r}
plot(net2, vertex.label = NA, vertex.size = 7, layout = layout_as_bipartite)

# using tidygraph
as_tbl_graph(x = links2, directed = TRUE) %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  left_join(nodes2, by = c("name" = "id")) %>%
  ggraph(., layout = "igraph", algorithm = "bipartite") +
  geom_edge_link0() +
  geom_node_point(aes(shape = type, fill = type, size = type)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = if_else(type, "", media)), colour = "white", size = 3) +
  
  scale_shape_manual(
    "Type",
    values = c(22, 21),
    labels = c("Media", "Persons"),
    guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 6))
  ) +
  
  scale_fill_manual(
    "Type",
    values = c("dodgerblue", "orange"),
    labels = c("Media", "Persons")
  ) +
  
  scale_size_manual(values = c(10, 4), guide = "none") 
```

- Using text as nodes:
```{r}
par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(net2, vertex.shape = "none", vertex.label = nodes2$media,
     vertex.label.color = V(net2)$color, vertex.label.font = 2,
     vertex.label.cex = .95, edge.color = "gray70",  edge.width = 2)

# Using tidygraph
as_tbl_graph(x = links2, directed = TRUE) %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  left_join(nodes2, by = c("name" = "id")) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "nicely") +
  geom_edge_link(end_cap = circle(.4,"cm"),

- Using images as nodes
You will need the 'png' package to do this:

```{r}
# install.packages("png")
library("png")

img.1 <- readPNG("./images/news.png")
img.2 <- readPNG("./images/user.png")

V(net2)$raster <- list(img.1, img.2)[V(net2)$type+1]

par(mar = c(3,3,3,3))

plot(net2, vertex.shape = "raster", vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = 16, vertex.size2 = 16, edge.width = 2)


# By the way, you can also add any image you want to any plot. For example, many #network graphs could be improved by a photo of a puppy carrying a basket full of kittens.
img.3 <- readPNG("./images/puppy.png")
rasterImage(img.3,  xleft = -1.7, xright = 0, ybottom = -1.2, ytop = 0)
# The numbers after the image are coordinates for the plot.
# The limits of your plotting area are given in par()$usr
```




```{r}
# Using ~~tidygraph~~ visNetwork
# See this cheatsheet:
# system.file("fontAwesome/Font_Awesome_Cheatsheet.pdf", package = "visNetwork")
library(visNetwork)

as_tbl_graph(x = links2, directed = TRUE) %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  left_join(nodes2, by = c("name" = "id")) %>% 
  
  # visNetwork needs a "group" variable for grouping...
  mutate(group = as.character(type)) %>% 
  visIgraph(.) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "FALSE",shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f26c", size = 75, color = "orange")) %>% 
  visGroups(groupname = "TRUE",shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f007", size = 75)) %>% 
  addFontAwesome()
```


We can also generate and plot **bipartite projections** for the **two-mode network** : (co-memberships are easy to calculate by multiplying the network matrix by its transposed matrix, or using igraph's `bipartite.projection` function)

```{r}
net2.bp <- bipartite.projection(net2)

#We can calculate the projections manually as well:
as_incidence_matrix(net2)  %*% t(as_incidence_matrix(net2))
t(as_incidence_matrix(net2)) %*%   as_incidence_matrix(net2)

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

plot(
  net2.bp$proj1,
  vertex.label.color = "black",
  vertex.label.dist = 2,
  vertex.label = nodes2$media[!is.na(nodes2$media.type)]
)

plot(
  net2.bp$proj2,
  vertex.label.color = "black",
  vertex.label.dist = 2,
  vertex.label = nodes2$media[is.na(nodes2$media.type)]
)
```

```{r}
# Using tidygraph
# Calculate projections and add attributes/labels
proj1 <-
  as_incidence_matrix(net2)  %*% t(as_incidence_matrix(net2)) %>%
  as_tbl_graph() %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  left_join(., nodes2, by = c("name" = "id"))
proj2 <-
  t(as_incidence_matrix(net2)) %*%   as_incidence_matrix(net2) %>% as_tbl_graph() %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  left_join(., nodes2, by = c("name" = "id"))


p1 <- proj1 %>%
  ggraph(layout = "graphopt") +
  geom_edge_link0() +
  geom_node_point(size = 6, colour = "orange") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = media), repel = TRUE)

p2 <- proj2 %>%
  ggraph(layout = "graphopt") +
  geom_edge_link0() +
  geom_node_point(
    aes(colour = media.type),
    size = 6,
    shape  = 15,
    colour = "dodgerblue"
  ) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = media), repel = TRUE)

p1 + p2
```


## 5. Plotting multiplex networks

In some cases, the networks we want to plot are **multigraphs**: they can have multiple edges connecting the same two nodes. A related concept, **multiplex networks**, contain multiple types of ties -- e.g. friendship, romantic, and work relationships between individuals.

In our example network, we also have two tie types: hyperlinks and mentions. One thing we can do is plot each type of tie separately:

```{r}

E(net)$width <- 2
plot(
  net,
  edge.color = c("dark red", "slategrey")[(E(net)$type == "hyperlink") +
                                            1],
  vertex.color = "gray40",
  layout = layout_in_circle,
  edge.curved = .3
)

# Another way to delete edges using the minus operator:
net.m <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type == "hyperlink"]
net.h <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type == "mention"]

#Plot the two links separately:
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

plot(net.h,
     vertex.color = "orange",
     layout = layout_with_fr,
     main = "Tie: Hyperlink")
plot(net.m,
     vertex.color = "lightsteelblue2",
     layout = layout_with_fr,
     main = "Tie: Mention")
```


- Make sure the nodes stay in the same place in both plots:

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(1, 1, 4, 1))

l <- layout_with_fr(net)
plot(net.h,
     vertex.color = "orange",
     layout = l,
     main = "Tie: Hyperlink")
plot(net.m,
     vertex.color = "lightsteelblue2",
     layout = l,
     main = "Tie: Mention")

```


```{r}
#Using tidygraph

layout <- layout_in_circle(net)
p1 <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(type == "hyperlink") %>% 
  
  # reusing the earlier computed layout
  ggraph(layout = layout) +
  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, 
                  fill = "orange") +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + 
  labs(title = "Tie: Hyperlink") + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,,
        legend.position = "bottom")

p2 <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  filter(type == "mention") %>% 
   # reusing the earlier computed layout
  ggraph(layout = layout) +
  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, 
                  fill = "lightsteelblue2") +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + 
  labs(title = "Tie: Mention") + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, legend.position = "bottom")

wrap_plots(p1, p2,guides = "collect") & 
  # note this "pipe" for patchwork!
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```


In our example network, we don't have **node dyads** connected by multiple types of connections (we never have both a 'hyperlink' and a 'mention' tie between the same two news outlets) -- however that could happen.

Note: See the edges between `s03` and `s10`...these are in opposite directions. So no dyads.

```{r}
layout <- layout_in_circle(net)
tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>%  
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% 

  # reusing the earlier computed layout
  ggraph(layout = layout) +
  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05, aes(colour = type)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, 
                  fill = "orange") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), repel = TRUE) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + 
  labs(title = "Tie: Hyperlink") + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,,
        legend.position = "bottom")
```

One challenge in visualizing multiplex networks is that multiple edges between the same two nodes may get plotted on top of each other in a way that makes them impossible to distinguish. For example, let us generate a simple multiplex network with two nodes and three ties between them:

```{r}
multigtr <- graph(edges = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), n = 2)

l <- layout_with_kk(multigtr)

# Let's just plot the graph:
plot(
  multigtr,
  vertex.color = "lightsteelblue",
  vertex.frame.color = "white",
  vertex.size = 40,
  vertex.shape = "circle",
  vertex.label = NA,
  edge.color = c("gold", "tomato", "yellowgreen"),
  edge.width = 10,
  edge.arrow.size = 5,
  edge.curved = 0.1,
  layout = l
)

# Using tidygraph
multigtr %>% 
  as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(edge_col = c("gold", "tomato", "yellowgreen")) %>% 
ggraph(., layout = l) +
  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.1, aes(colour = edge_col)) + 
  geom_node_point(size = 4, colour = "lightsteelblue") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Because all edges in the graph have the same curvature, they are drawn over each other so that we only see the last one. What we can do is assign each edge a different curvature. One useful function in 'igraph' called `curve_multiple()` can help us here. For a graph G, `curve.multiple(G)` will generate a curvature for each edge that maximizes visibility.

```{r}
plot(
  multigtr,
  vertex.color = "lightsteelblue",
  vertex.frame.color = "white",
  vertex.size = 40,
  vertex.shape = "circle",
  vertex.label = NA,
  edge.color = c("gold", "tomato", "yellowgreen"),
  edge.width = 10,
  edge.arrow.size = 5,
  edge.curved = curve_multiple(multigtr),
  layout = l
)
```
```{r}
multigtr %>% 
  as_tbl_graph() %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(edge_col = c("gold", "tomato", "yellowgreen")) %>% 
ggraph(., layout = l) +
  geom_edge_fan(strength = 0.1, aes(colour = edge_col),width = 2) + 
  geom_node_point(size = 4, colour = "lightsteelblue") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
