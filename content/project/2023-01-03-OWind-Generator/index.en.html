<p>This solution to urban “micro-power” generation has won numerous awards,
most notably the <a href="https://www.jamesdysonaward.org/2018/project/o-wind-turbine/">James Dyson Award in
2018</a>. The
inventors are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicorellana/">Nicolas
Orellana</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaseen-noorani-b5402a79/?originalSubdomain=uk">Yaseen
Noorani</a>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let us do a TRIZ Analysis of this remarkable
invention.</p>
<div id="a-triz-analysis-of-the-dyson-o-wind-generator" class="section level2">
<h2>A TRIZ Analysis of the Dyson O-Wind Generator</h2>
<p>For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as
<a href="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/" title="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"><strong>before</strong></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, using the method described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k" title="Open Source TRIZ on YouTube"><strong>Open Source
TRIZ</strong></a><strong>,</strong>
we identify <em>knobs</em> or <em>parameters</em> within the situation</li>
<li>We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /
Cause for a Problem in the form of a <em>Contradiction</em>.</li>
<li>Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and
look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive
Principles.</li>
<li>Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the video itself, we heard about how electrical power <strong>consumption
centers</strong> are the urban areas and these are far away from the
<strong>generation sites</strong>. This leads to capital costs in HT Transmission
equipment; we go to HT transmission to reduce losses on the way. This is
already a <em>Contradiction</em>, which we might solve using <strong>Segmentation</strong>
to arrive at <em>Local Generation of Power</em>. Local generation is a good
idea to reduce these costs. This leads easily to Solar Panels on
rooftops for example. Again while this <em>may</em> be cheaper than the
electrical distribution system, it still uses a fair bit of capex and
space and is centralized per building. Can we take <strong>Segmentation</strong> even
further and think of a hyper-local <em>household-based</em> power generation
unit, using the Wind?</p>
<p>What would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around
the home? Here below is a quick <em>Ishikawa Diagram</em> to help us identify
the <em>Parameters</em> of this Problem:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Looking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them
off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up
several problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked
some of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and
not direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that
some these may sound <em>naive</em>, but that is exactly way to start!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I would like to have access my generator, but it needs to be not too
close to the walls for it to harness the wind.</li>
<li>How to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection
wires get twisted?</li>
<li>Do I need a conventional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_(electric)">Commutator</a>?
Won’t that be heavy?</li>
<li>What voltage and current will I get? Will it be compatible with my
230V AC mains?</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our
attention. Let us cut to the chase and state perhaps the most
interesting problem (to me!) that the inventors have solved as
demonstrated in the video above. We will state this as an
<a href="https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp" title="https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp"><strong>Administrative
Contradiction(AC)</strong></a>
in <em>plain English</em>:</p>
</div>
<div id="administrative-contradiction" class="section level2 callout-note">
<h2>Administrative Contradiction</h2>
<p><strong>AC</strong>: Winds help to generate power by making something rotate, but
winds can change direction and slow down the existing rotation.</p>
</div>
<p>What would an IFR be in this situation? How “unreasonable” can we be?
Let us try:</p>
<div id="ideal-final-result" class="section level2 callout-important">
<h2>Ideal Final Result</h2>
<p>Torque must be in one direction only (irrespective of wind direction)</p>
</div>
<div id="unidirectional-assumption" class="section level2 callout-caution">
<h2>Unidirectional Assumption</h2>
<p>I have made a strong assumption here about the the unidirectional
movement: the main intent is for the rotating generator to be able to
harness winds from any direction to establish or continue rotation in
one direction (CW or CCW). Alternating current power generation is in
principle immune to direction of rotation.</p>
</div>
<p>Let us take our AC and convert it into a <em>Technical Contradiction(TC)</em>,
keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the <em>48 TRIZ Parameters</em> in
the <a href="/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf"><strong>TRIZ</strong></a>
<a href="/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf" title="Download PDF of TRIZ Contradiction Matrix 2003"><strong>Contradiction</strong></a>
<a href="/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf"><strong>Matrix(PDF)</strong></a> and see which
Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what
we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<div id="technical-contradictions" class="section level2 callout-note">
<h2>Technical Contradictions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TC 1</strong>: Improve <code>(15)Force/Torque</code> while not worsening
<code>(3)Angle/Length of Moving Object</code></li>
<li><strong>TC 2</strong>: Improve <code>(3)Angle/Length of Moving Object</code> while not
worsening <code>(15)Force/Torque</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Again we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters based on our IFR. Other
metaphoric TRIZ Parameters that may suggest themselves are
<code>12(Duration of Action on a Moving Object)</code>, <code>14(Speed)</code>, and
<code>(40)Harmful Effects Acting on the System</code>.</p>
<p>Is there a <em>Physical Contradiction(PC)</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> possible here?</p>
<div id="physical-contradiction" class="section level2 callout-warning">
<h2>Physical Contradiction</h2>
<p>The Rotor must yield and not yield to the Wind at the same time. In
other words, the rotor must be “porous and non-porous”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> to the wind
at the same time.</p>
</div>
<p>Let us now apply the TCs to the Contradiction Matrix and obtain the TRIZ
Inventive Principles.</p>
<div id="solving-the-technical-contradiction" class="section level2">
<h2>Solving the Technical Contradiction</h2>
<p>Let us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive
at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix
suggests:</p>
<p>For <code>TC-1</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>17(Another Dimension) !!</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>4( Asymmetry)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>14(Curvature) !!!</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>10(Preliminary Action)</strong></p>
<p>and with <code>TC-2</code>:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3(Local Quality)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>9(Preliminary Anti-Action)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>35(Parameter Change)</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Hmm…based on the PC, we may have expected a <strong>Separation in Space</strong>
solution, suggested by <em>Curvature, Another Dimension and Asymmetry</em>.
Viewing these Inventive Principles as we <u><em>Generalized
Solutions</em></u><em>,</em> we try to map these back into the Problem at
hand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ
embodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics,
geography, and biology.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>(14)Curvature</strong>: Hmm…nothing new here, or is there? Of course
the rotor has to be curved and kind of sphere-like….</p></li>
<li><p><strong>17(Another Dimension)</strong>: A near-spherical thing has really only
one dimension..the radius. And that points in all directions /
dimensions! Should there be changes in radius then? Should the
radius change create bumps ( positive change ) or depressions (
negative change?) Should the bump be like a welt, and the depression
like a groove? How can a bump or a depression <em>itself</em> be curved, as
<strong>14(Curvature)</strong> suggests?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>4(Asymmetry)</strong>: The bumps or depressions…..they have to be
asymmetric? So….not like <em>longitudes</em> and nor <em>latitudes</em>, but may
be like those <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatCircle.html" title="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatCircle.html"><strong>great
circles</strong></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3(Local Quality)</strong>: OK, the bumps or depressions are already
“local”….can we go further? Here is where I stretch and go
<em>hyper-local</em>: Should there be structures on or inside them, like
flaps or fins or vanes? How can these be <em>asymmetric</em>, then? By
acting like miniature flaps or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLfrZrXC-g" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLfrZrXC-g">trapdoors</a>,
that yield / fall flat when pushed in one direction and stand up /
resist when pushed in the other direction…somewhat like a dog or
cat’s fur? Then <em>push</em> and <em>pull</em> work differently…</p>
<div class="callout-tip">
<h2 id="from-flaps-to-.funnels">From Flaps to ….Funnels!</h2>
<p>Making these flaps <em>movable</em> as the above paragraph seems to suggest
would probably not be a good idea, from an engineering standpoint.
But once we have the image of <em>wind + flaps / fins / vanes</em> and
<em>differences in pressure or movement</em>, the <strong>Bernoulli Principle</strong>
and <strong>Venturi effect</strong> suggest themselves immediately!! So what
could this vane-fin-fur-flap thingy be then? Oh good heavens, a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TQL1ju3RoQ" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TQL1ju3RoQ"><strong>funnel</strong></a>
!!!</p>
</div>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Venturi5.svg" alt="Venturi Effect" />{HappyApple,
Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons}</p>
<p>So each of those bumps are <strong>segmented</strong> into funnel-like structures
that cause differences in air pressure when the wind blow. These
differences are <em>unidirectional</em> and create movement/rotation! And
because the bumps are curved along the surface of the sphere, <em>and
they are not parallel to one another</em> (<strong>asymmetry</strong>), at least some
of the internal funnels will always be “in the wind” <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and
capable of creating rotation using Bernoulli/Venturi effect!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>9(Preliminary Anti-Action)</strong>: What do we wish to guard against?
Counter acting wind forces. Well, the funnel structures work only
with wind blowing into the broad opening and so we are fine!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So finally we could just imagine a spherical object, mounted on a
spindle, with spiral arc-like bumps at different places on the surfaces.
Within the arc-like bumps are funnel-like structures that create
differentials in pressure when subject to the wind, and that creates
rotation. Since the funnels are asymmetric by nature, our final rotation
is unidirectional. Whew! ( Yes, that “whew” is also very suggestive here
😃!)</p>
</div>
<div id="using-triz-separation-principles" class="section level2">
<h2>Using TRIZ Separation Principles</h2>
<p>As Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying <strong>physical</strong>
parameter, such as <em>length</em>, <em>breadth</em>, <em>weight</em>, or <em>energy, or speed</em>
for example that lies at the root of our <em>Technical Contradiction</em>.</p>
<p>Our IFR states that we want the rotor to yield one way and to not yield
when pushed the other way so it needs to be both hard and soft at the
same time. This is a Physical Contradiction! In this case we can easily
see and application of <span class="smallcaps"><strong>Separation in Space</strong></span> and also
<span class="smallcaps"><strong>Separation on Condition</strong>.</span> However I think in this case,
it would not be easy to arrive at the Solution using just these.</p>
<p>That’s a wrap! In the next episode of the <em>#TRIZ Chronicles</em>, I wish to
step even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR! I think
looking at some of the institution-building ideas in Ricardo Semler’s
book,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994" title="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994"><strong>Maverick</strong></a>
would be a good idea!</p>
