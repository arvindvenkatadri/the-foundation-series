<p>Wildlife roadkill was a serious problem in <a href="https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/banff">Banff National
Park</a> in Canada, for both
wildlife and motorists. The problem was tackled beautifully by Parks
Canada using a system of tunnels and stunning natural-looking overpasses.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let us do a TRIZ Analysis of this remarkable set of
inventions.</p>

<h2>{{&lt; iconify pajamas issue-type-test-case &gt;}} A TRIZ Analysis of the Banff Wildlife Crossings</h2>
<p>For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as
<a href="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/" title="https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"><strong>before</strong></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, using the method described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k" title="Open Source TRIZ on YouTube"><strong>Open Source TRIZ</strong></a><strong>,</strong>
we identify <em>knobs</em> or <em>parameters</em> within the situation</li>
<li>We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /
Cause for a Problem in the form of a <em>Contradiction</em>.</li>
<li>Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and
look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive
Principles.</li>
<li>Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here below is a quick <em>Ishikawa Diagram</em> to help us identify the
<em>Parameters</em> of this Problem:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Looking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them
off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up
several problem statements. Let us state some of our Problems</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Signage</em> would help drivers <em>slow down</em>, but slowing down may make
journey less enjoyable.</li>
<li><em>Slowing Down</em> may improve <em>animal movement</em> but may endanger
humans.</li>
<li><em>Clearing the Vegetation</em> may make animals more <em>visible</em>, but may
also make <em>vehicles</em> visible to animals and affect their movement</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our
attention. Let us cut to the chase and state our <a href="https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp" title="https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp"><strong>Administrative
Contradiction(AC)</strong></a>
in <em>plain English</em>:</p>
</div>
<div id="iconify-icon-park-outline-reverse-operation-out-administrative-contradiction" class="section level2 callout-note">
<h2>{{&lt; iconify icon-park-outline reverse-operation-out &gt;}} Administrative Contradiction</h2>
<p><strong>AC</strong>: We wish to drive at high speeds, but not kill migrating wild
animals nor endanger our vehicles.</p>
</div>
<p>What would an IFR be in this situation? How “unreasonable” can we be?
Let us try:</p>
<div id="iconify-cib-ideal-ideal-final-result" class="section level2 callout-important">
<h2>{{&lt; iconify cib ideal &gt;}} Ideal Final Result</h2>
<p>The Animals and Humans should both use the Road whenever they want
without being mutually affected!</p>
</div>
<p>Let us take our AC and convert it into a <em>Technical Contradiction(TC)</em>,
keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the <em>48 TRIZ Parameters</em> in
the <a href="../../materials/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf"><strong>TRIZ Contradiction
Matrix</strong></a> and see which
Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what
we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradictions both ways<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<div id="iconify-icon-park-reverse-operation-out-technical-contradictions" class="section level2 callout-note">
<h2>{{&lt; iconify icon-park reverse-operation-out &gt;}} Technical Contradictions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TC1</strong>: Improve <code>Loss of Time(26)</code> and not worsen
<code>Duration of Action by Moving Object(12)</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Since our IFR is all about <strong>time</strong>, we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters
that are <strong>time-oriented</strong>. We could have also tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TC2</strong>: Improve <code>Volume of Moving Object(7)</code> and not worsen
<code>Loss of Time(26)</code></li>
<li><strong>TC3</strong>: Improve <code>Other harmful factors Acting on the System(40)</code>
and not worsen <code>Duration of Action by Stationary Object(13)</code><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><br />
</li>
<li>These include <em>Volume</em> and <em>External Factors</em> which are not quite
there in out IFR. Is there a <em>Physical Contradiction(PC)</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
possible here?</li>
</ul>
<div id="iconify-icon-park-solid-reverse-operation-out-physical-contradiction" class="section level2 callout-warning">
<h2>{{&lt; iconify icon-park-solid reverse-operation-out &gt;}} Physical Contradiction</h2>
<p>In fact our IFR is nearly worded as a PC: The Vehicles and the Animals
must use the Road <strong>at the Same Time</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="iconify-game-icons-multiple-targets-solving-the-technical-contradictions" class="section level2">
<h2>{{&lt; iconify game-icons multiple-targets &gt;}} Solving the Technical Contradictions</h2>
<p>Let us take the set of TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at
the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix suggests:</p>
<p>For <code>TC1</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>3(Local Quality)</li>
<li>17(<strong>Another Dimension</strong>)</li>
<li>28(Mechanics Substitution)</li>
<li>8(Anti-Weight); and</li>
<li>19(Periodic Action),</li>
<li>10(Preliminary Action)</li>
</ol>
<p>Hmm…based on the PC, we may have expected a <strong>Separation in Space</strong>
solution, suggested by <em>Another Dimension</em> and <em>Local Quality.</em> Viewing
these Inventive Principles as we <u><em>Generalized
Solutions</em></u><em>,</em> we try to map these back into the Problem at
hand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ
embodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics,
geography, and biology.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>3(Local Quality):</strong> So something that is local…local where?
Well, along the highway, of course. So something that is located a
specific points along the highway. Nice but not really clear enough
to be actionable, yet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>17(Another Dimension)</strong>: Well, well. The Road is a linear thing
and has length and breadth. What would we use for <em>another dimension</em>?
Height, of course! So, we need to go either above the
road or below! And that leads us to a …bridge and a tunnel !!!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The other Inventive Principles are, to me, not evocative enough in this instance. But we already have a decent idea: we could just imagine a <strong>set</strong> of <strong>Local</strong> bridges and tunnels that occur at <strong>Periodic</strong> Intervals along the highway. And that is exactly what Parks Canada have done.</p>

<p>Here is the solution in action:</p>

</div>
<div id="iconify-fluent-mdl2-parameter-using-triz-separation-principles" class="section level2">
<h2>{{&lt; iconify fluent-mdl2 parameter &gt;}} Using TRIZ Separation Principles</h2>
<p>As Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying <strong>physical</strong>
parameter, such as <em>length</em>, <em>breadth</em>, <em>weight</em>, or <em>energy, or speed</em>
for example that lies at the root of our <em>Technical Contradiction</em>. Our IFR states that we want the humans and animals to use the road at the same TIME, and hence <strong>Separation in Space</strong> becomes a nice way to think of a solution.</p>
<p>That’s a wrap! In the next episode of the <em>#TRIZ Chronicles</em>, I wish to
step even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR! I think
looking at some of the institution-building ideas in Ricardo Semler’s
book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994" title="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994"><strong>Maverick</strong></a> would be a good idea!</p>
