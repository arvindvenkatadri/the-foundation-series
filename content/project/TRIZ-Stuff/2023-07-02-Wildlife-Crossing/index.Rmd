## {{< iconify openmoji japanese-symbol-for-beginner >}} Introduction

Here we go with another of my *TRIZ Chronicles* ! The earlier editions
are here: [**Lawrence of
Arabia**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ "https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"),

[**Great Bubble
Barrier**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2023-02-09-plastics/ "https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2023-02-09-plastics/"),
and the [**OWind
Turbine**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2023-01-03-owind-generator/).

This is another piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative
Thinking and Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*,
over the past 8 years or more at the [**Srishti Manipal Institute of
Art, Design, and
Technology**](https://www.srishtimanipalinstitute.in/ "https://www.srishtimanipalinstitute.in/")
and now at [**DSU School of Commerce & Management
Studies**](https://www.dsu.edu.in/commerce-management "https://www.dsu.edu.in/commerce-management")**,**
both in Bangalore, INDIA**.**

Wildlife roadkill was a serious problem in [Banff National
Park](https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/banff) in Canada, for both
wildlife and motorists. The problem was tackled beautifully by Parks
Canada using a system of tunnels and stunning natural-looking overpasses.

Without further ado, let us do a TRIZ Analysis of this remarkable set of
inventions.

## {{< iconify pajamas issue-type-test-case >}} A TRIZ Analysis of the Banff Wildlife Crossings

For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as
[**before**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/ "https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/"):

-   First, using the method described in [**Open Source TRIZ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k "Open Source TRIZ on YouTube")**,**
    we identify *knobs* or *parameters* within the situation
-   We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /
    Cause for a Problem in the form of a *Contradiction*.
-   Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and
    look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive
    Principles.
-   Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.

Here below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify the
*Parameters* of this Problem:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Cause and Effect Diagram or Fish- bone Sample
library(qcc)
library(SixSigma)

#Effect
effect <- "Safe Wildlife Crossing\n and Fast Human Journeys"

#Causes
causes.head <- c("Measurement", "Material", "Methods", "Environment", "Manpower", "Machines")

#Individual Causes
causes <- vector(mode =  "list", length = length(causes.head))
causes[1] <- list(c("Animal Size", "Solo or Herd","Time of Movement", "Duration of Movement", "Vehicle Size", "Vehicle Speed", "Visibility"))

causes[2] <- list(c("Vegetation", "Road Surface", "Road Signage"))

causes[3] <- list(c("Clearing of Vegetation?", "Humans: Enjoy Journey Safely", "Animals:Cross Highway Safely", "Slow Down"))

causes[4] <- list(c("Forests", "Snow","Highway"))

causes[5] <- list(c("Drivers","Park Guards"))
causes[6] <- list(c("Vehicles", "Roads","Signage", "Lights?"))

#Fishbone Diagram
#
ss.ceDiag(effect,causes.head,causes, main ="Where is the Bear?",
          #ss.col = c("black", "red"), 
          sub = paste("Ishikawa Cause-Effect Diagram \n (Made with R)"))



```

Looking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them
off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up
several problem statements. Let us state some of our Problems

1.  *Signage* would help drivers *slow down*, but slowing down may make
    journey less enjoyable.
2.  *Slowing Down* may improve *animal movement* but may endanger
    humans.
3.  *Clearing the Vegetation* may make animals more *visible*, but may
    also make *vehicles* visible to animals and affect their movement

As you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our
attention. Let us cut to the chase and state our [**Administrative
Contradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp "https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp")
in *plain English*:

::: callout-note
## {{< iconify icon-park-outline reverse-operation-out >}} Administrative Contradiction

**AC**: We wish to drive at high speeds, but not kill migrating wild
animals nor endanger our vehicles.
:::

What would an IFR be in this situation? How "unreasonable" can we be?
Let us try:

::: callout-important
## {{< iconify cib ideal >}} Ideal Final Result

The Animals and Humans should both use the Road whenever they want
without being mutually affected!
:::

Let us take our AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,
keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in
the [**TRIZ Contradiction
Matrix**](../../materials/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see which
Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what
we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradictions both ways[^1]:

::: callout-note
## {{< iconify icon-park reverse-operation-out >}} Technical Contradictions

-   **TC1**: Improve `Loss of Time(26)` and not worsen
    `Duration of Action by Moving Object(12)`
:::

Since our IFR is all about **time**, we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters
that are **time-oriented**. We could have also tried the following:

-   **TC2**: Improve `Volume of Moving Object(7)` and not worsen
    `Loss of Time(26)`
-   **TC3**: Improve `Other harmful factors Acting on the System(40)`
    and not worsen `Duration of Action by Stationary Object(13)`[^2]\
-   These include *Volume* and *External Factors* which are not quite
    there in out IFR. Is there a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^3]
    possible here?

::: callout-warning
## {{< iconify icon-park-solid reverse-operation-out >}} Physical Contradiction

In fact our IFR is nearly worded as a PC: The Vehicles and the Animals
must use the Road **at the Same Time**.
:::

## {{< iconify game-icons multiple-targets >}} Solving the Technical Contradictions

Let us take the set of TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at
the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix suggests:

For `TC1`:

1.  3(Local Quality)
2.  17(**Another Dimension**)
3.  28(Mechanics Substitution)
4.  8(Anti-Weight); and
5.  19(Periodic Action),
6.  10(Preliminary Action)

Hmm...based on the PC, we may have expected a **Separation in Space**
solution, suggested by *Another Dimension* and *Local Quality.* Viewing
these Inventive Principles as we [*Generalized
Solutions*]{.underline}*,* we try to map these back into the Problem at
hand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ
embodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics,
geography, and biology.

1.  **3(Local Quality):** So something that is local...local where?
    Well, along the highway, of course. So something that is located a
    specific points along the highway. Nice but not really clear enough
    to be actionable, yet.

2.  **17(Another Dimension)**: Well, well. The Road is a linear thing
    and has length and breadth. What would we use for *another dimension*?
    Height, of course! So, we need to go either above the
    road or below! And that leads us to a ...bridge and a tunnel !!!

The other Inventive Principles are, to me, not evocative enough in this instance. But we already have a decent idea: we could just imagine a **set** of **Local** bridges and tunnels that occur at **Periodic** Intervals along the highway. And that is exactly what Parks Canada have done.

Here is the solution in action:

{{< video https://youtu.be/9JX6cqME6Hw >}}

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 parameter >}} Using TRIZ Separation Principles

As Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying **physical**
parameter, such as *length*, *breadth*, *weight*, or *energy, or speed*
for example that lies at the root of our *Technical Contradiction*. Our IFR states that we want the humans and animals to use the road at the same TIME, and hence **Separation in Space** becomes a nice way to think of a solution. 

That's a wrap! In the next episode of the *#TRIZ Chronicles*, I wish to
step even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR! I think
looking at some of the institution-building ideas in Ricardo Semler's
book, [**Maverick**](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994 "https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994") would be a good idea!

[^1]: The Contradiction Matrix is not quite symmetric, so stating the
    Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of
    Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.

[^2]: Animals are nearly stationary compared to the vehicles.

[^3]: Arriving at *Physical Contradictions* is not always easy! If we
    can, then there are a very crisp set of **TRIZ Separation
    Principles** that we can apply to solve the Problem.
