# Introduction

Here we go with another of my *TRIZ Chronicles* ! The earlier editions
are here: <u>[**Lawrence of
Arabia**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/triz-stuff/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/)</u>,
<u>[**Spotify**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/triz-stuff/2023-01-09-triz-spotify/)</u>,
and the <u>[**Great Bubble
Barrier**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/triz-stuff/2023-02-09-plastics/)</u>.

This is another piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative
Thinking and Problem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*,
over the past 8 years or more at the <u>[**Srishti Manipal Institute of
Art, Design, and
Technology**](https://www.srishtimanipalinstitute.in/)</u>
and now at <u>[**DSU School of Commerce & Management Studies**](https://www.dsu.edu.in/commerce-management)</u>,
both in Bangalore, INDIA.

This solution to urban "micro-power" generation has won numerous awards,
most notably the <u>[James Dyson Award in
2018](https://www.jamesdysonaward.org/2018/project/o-wind-turbine/)</u>. The
inventors are <u>[Nicolas
Orellana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicorellana/)</u> and <u>[Yaseen
Noorani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaseen-noorani-b5402a79/?originalSubdomain=uk)</u>.

Without further ado, let us do a TRIZ Analysis of this remarkable
invention.

## A TRIZ Analysis of the Dyson O-Wind Generator

For a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as
[**before**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/triz-stuff/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/):

-   First, using the method described in <u>[**Open Source TRIZ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k "Open Source TRIZ on YouTube")</u>,
    we identify *knobs* or *parameters* within the situation
-   We see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement /
    Cause for a Problem in the form of a *Contradiction*.
-   Re-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and
    look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive
    Principles.
-   Apply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.

In the video itself, we heard about how electrical power **consumption
centers** are the urban areas and these are far away from the
**generation sites**. This leads to capital costs in HT Transmission
equipment; we go to HT transmission to reduce losses on the way. This is
already a *Contradiction*, which we might solve using **Segmentation**
to arrive at *Local Generation of Power*. Local generation is a good
idea to reduce these costs. This leads easily to Solar Panels on
rooftops for example. Again while this *may* be cheaper than the
electrical distribution system, it still uses a fair bit of capex and
space and is centralized per building. Can we take **Segmentation** even
further and think of a hyper-local *household-based* power generation
unit, using the Wind?

What would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around
the home? Here below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify
the *Parameters* of this Problem:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Cause and Effect Diagram or Fish- bone Sample
library(qcc)
library(SixSigma)

#Effect
effect <- "Hyper Local Wind Power Generation"

#Causes
causes.head <- c("Measurement", "Material", "Methods", "Environment", "Manpower", "Machines")

#Individual Causes
causes <- vector(mode =  "list", length = length(causes.head))
causes[1] <- list(c("Wind Direction", "Wind Velocity"))

causes[2] <- list(c("Wires","Apartment Walls"))

causes[3] <- list(c("Suspension", "Exposure", "Access", "Maintenance"))

causes[4] <- list(c("Urban", "Buildings", "External Walls"))

causes[5] <- list(c("Residents","Neighbours", "Birds"))
causes[6] <- list(c("Mech Arrangements", "Electrical"))

#Fishbone Diagram
#
ss.ceDiag(effect,causes.head,causes, main ="Where is the Wind?",
          #ss.col = c("", "red"), 
          sub = paste("Ishikawa Cause-Effect Diagram \n (Made with R)"))



```

Looking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them
off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up
several problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked
some of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and
not direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that
some these may sound *naive*, but that is exactly way to start!

1.  I would like to have access my generator, but it needs to be not too
    close to the walls for it to harness the wind.
2.  How to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection
    wires get twisted?
3.  Do I need a conventional
    <u>[Commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_(electric))</u>?
    Won't that be heavy?
4.  What voltage and current will I get? Will it be compatible with my
    230V AC mains?

As you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our
attention. Let us cut to the chase and state perhaps the most
interesting problem (to me!) that the inventors have solved as
demonstrated in the video above. We will state this as an
<u>[**Administrative
Contradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp "https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp")</u>
in *plain English*:

::: callout-note
## Administrative Contradiction

**AC**: Winds help to generate power by making something rotate, but
winds can change direction and slow down the existing rotation.
:::

What would an IFR be in this situation? How "unreasonable" can we be?
Let us try:

::: callout-important
## Ideal Final Result

Torque must be in one direction only (irrespective of wind direction)
:::

::: callout-caution
## Unidirectional Assumption

I have made a strong assumption here about the the unidirectional
movement: the main intent is for the rotating generator to be able to
harness winds from any direction to establish or continue rotation in
one direction (CW or CCW). Alternating current power generation is in
principle immune to direction of rotation.
:::

Let us take our AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,
keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in
the <u>[**TRIZ Contradiction Matrix(PDF)**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf)</u> and see which
Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what
we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways[^1]:

[^1]: The Contradiction Matrix is not quite symmetric, so stating the
    Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of
    Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.

::: callout-note
## Technical Contradictions

-   **TC 1**: Improve `(15)Force/Torque` while not worsening
    `(3)Angle/Length of Moving Object`
-   **TC 2**: Improve `(3)Angle/Length of Moving Object` while not
    worsening `(15)Force/Torque`
:::

Again we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters based on our IFR. Other
metaphoric TRIZ Parameters that may suggest themselves are
`12(Duration of Action on a Moving Object)`, `14(Speed)`, and
`(40)Harmful Effects Acting on the System`.

Is there a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^2] possible here?

[^2]: Arriving at *Physical Contradictions* is not always easy! If we
    can, then there are a very crisp set of **TRIZ Separation
    Principles** that we can apply to solve the Problem.

::: callout-warning
## Physical Contradiction

The Rotor must yield and not yield to the Wind at the same time. In
other words, the rotor must be "porous and non-porous"[^3] to the wind
at the same time.
:::

[^3]: So the Rotor must have...holes? How do holes "work in one
    direction only"? We will see...

Let us now apply the TCs to the Contradiction Matrix and obtain the TRIZ
Inventive Principles.

## Solving the Technical Contradiction

Let us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive
at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix
suggests:

For `TC-1`:

1.  **17(Another Dimension) !!**

2.  **4( Asymmetry)**

3.  **14(Curvature) !!!**

4.  **10(Preliminary Action)**

    and with `TC-2`:

5.  **3(Local Quality)**

6.  **9(Preliminary Anti-Action)**

7.  **35(Parameter Change)**

Hmm...based on the PC, we may have expected a **Separation in Space**
solution, suggested by *Curvature, Another Dimension and Asymmetry*.
Viewing these Inventive Principles as we ***Generalized
Solutions*** we try to map these back into the Problem at
hand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ
embodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics,
geography, and biology.

1.  **(14)Curvature**: Hmm...nothing new here, or is there? Of course
    the rotor has to be curved and kind of sphere-like....

2.  **17(Another Dimension)**: A near-spherical thing has really only
    one dimension..the radius. And that points in all directions /
    dimensions! Should there be changes in radius then? Should the
    radius change create bumps ( positive change ) or depressions (
    negative change?) Should the bump be like a welt, and the depression
    like a groove? How can a bump or a depression *itself* be curved, as
    **14(Curvature)** suggests?

3.  **4(Asymmetry)**: The bumps or depressions.....they have to be
    asymmetric? So....not like *longitudes* and nor *latitudes*, but may
    be like those <u>[**great
    circles**](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatCircle.html)</u>.

4.  **3(Local Quality)**: OK, the bumps or depressions are already
    "local"....can we go further? Here is where I stretch and go
    *hyper-local*: Should there be structures on or inside them, like
    flaps or fins or vanes? How can these be *asymmetric*, then? By
    acting like miniature flaps or
    <u>[trapdoors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxLfrZrXC-g)</u>,
    that yield / fall flat when pushed in one direction and stand up /
    resist when pushed in the other direction...somewhat like a dog or
    cat's fur? Then *push* and *pull* work differently...

    ::: callout-tip
    ## From Flaps to ....Funnels!

    Making these flaps *movable* as the above paragraph seems to suggest
    would probably not be a good idea, from an engineering standpoint.
    But once we have the image of *wind + flaps / fins / vanes* and
    *differences in pressure or movement*, the **Bernoulli Principle**
    and **Venturi effect** suggest themselves immediately!! So what
    could this vane-fin-fur-flap thingy be then? Oh good heavens, a
    <u>[**funnel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TQL1ju3RoQ)</u>
    !!

    ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Venturi5.svg)

    So each of those bumps are **segmented** into funnel-like structures
    that cause differences in air pressure when the wind blow. These
    differences are *unidirectional* and create movement/rotation! And
    because the bumps are curved along the surface of the sphere, *and
    they are not parallel to one another* (**asymmetry**), at least some
    of the internal funnels will always be "in the wind" [^4], and
    capable of creating rotation using Bernoulli/Venturi effect!
    :::
    
5.  **9(Preliminary Anti-Action)**: What do we wish to guard against?
    Counter acting wind forces. Well, the funnel structures work only
    with wind blowing into the broad opening and so we are fine!

[^4]: Mathematically, the Wind direction vector will be (nearly) normal
    to the aperture of some funnel.

So finally we could just imagine a spherical object, mounted on a
spindle, with spiral arc-like bumps at different places on the surfaces.
Within the arc-like bumps are funnel-like structures that create
differentials in pressure when subject to the wind, and that creates
rotation. Since the funnels are asymmetric by nature, our final rotation
is unidirectional. Whew! ( Yes, that "whew" is also very suggestive here
😃!)

## Using TRIZ Separation Principles

As Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying **physical**
parameter, such as *length*, *breadth*, *weight*, or *energy, or speed*
for example that lies at the root of our *Technical Contradiction*.

Our IFR states that we want the rotor to yield one way and to not yield
when pushed the other way so it needs to be both hard and soft at the
same time. This is a Physical Contradiction! In this case we can easily
see and application of [**Separation in Space**]{.smallcaps} and also
[**Separation on Condition**.]{.smallcaps} However I think in this case,
it would not be easy to arrive at the Solution using just these.

That's a wrap! In the next episode of the *#TRIZ Chronicles*, I wish to
step even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR! I think
looking at some of the institution-building ideas in Ricardo Semler's
book,
<u>[**Maverick**](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32994)</u>
would be a good idea!
