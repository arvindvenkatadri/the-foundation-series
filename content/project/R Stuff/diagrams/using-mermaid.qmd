## Introduction
Using diagrams in Quarto seems to be easy, with mermaid
See this :

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-mermaid-flowchart
%%| fig-cap: Wow look how it flows.

graph TD
    A([Oooh]) --> B([Would You])
    B --> C([Look at This])
    C --> D[Very]
    C --> E[Fancy]
    C --> F[Flowchart]
```

Gantt Charts
If Figure 1 isn’t enough to convince you, how about some Gantt charts?

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-mermaid-gantt
%%| fig-cap: Oh you real fancy huh?

%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'themeVariables': { 'textColor': '#798189'}}}%%
gantt
    title Big Ol' Gantts
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
    Some Normal Tasks : done, a1, 2022-09-01, 15d
    But Wait, There's More! :after a1, 20d
    section And ANOTHER
    Deary Me, It's Never Ending : crit, 2022-10-01, 20d
    I Hate This Project : 14d
```


So you’ve got Figure 1 to wow people with your idea and Figure 2 to manage the project, but now you need some git graphs to show how you broke everything.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-mermaid-git
%%| fig-cap: Git a load of this!
