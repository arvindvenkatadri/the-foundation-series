## Introduction

We will briefly study the Big5/MBTI Personality Test Matrix and understand the "dichotomies" these embody. We will then use these to understand ourselves, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.

## Icebreaker Game!

Look at the slide full of numbers on the screen. I would like you to:  

- *Silently* work through the slide until you have found all the numbers   
- Raise your hand when you have done so. 


## A Personality Game

I have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:  

- Discuss how to complete the Task  
- Complete the Task and document your work  
- *Also* document the main aspects of Discussion in your group. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.   
- Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team

## Why does this Matter to Us

From the two exercises, we see that:  

  - Reality depends upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view. Note that this is about our *cognitive bias* that may depend upon our cultural outlook, and our ability to miss things. 
  - It is emphatically not about <u>[alternative facts](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/alternative-facts/)</u> which is arrant nonsense.
  - We all have our "default modes" for behaviour, that give us a restricted appreciation of the World
  - As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better. 
  - Comprehending reality better gives a stronger basis for Art/Design **decisions** and plans for action.
