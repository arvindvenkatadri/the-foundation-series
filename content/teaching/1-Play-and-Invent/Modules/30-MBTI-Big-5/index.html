<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We will briefly study the Big5/MBTI Personality Test Matrix and understand the “dichotomies” these embody. We will then use these to understand ourselves, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please complete the MBTI test at this website. <u><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" class="uri">https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test</a></u></li>
<li>On the Chart on the wall, you will see a sort of Matrix-like chart showing one cell for each MBTI Type. Please write in your name in the cell that shows your MBTI type.</li>
</ul>
<p>On with the Games!!</p>
</div>
<div id="icebreaker-game" class="section level2">
<h2>Icebreaker Game!</h2>
<p>Look at the slide full of numbers on the screen ( PPT is linked in the references below). I would like you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Silently</em> work through the slide until you have found all the numbers<br />
</li>
<li>Raise your hand when you have done so.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="a-team-game" class="section level2">
<h2>A Team Game</h2>
<p>I have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss how to complete the Task<br />
</li>
<li>Complete the Task and document your work<br />
</li>
<li><em>Also</em> document <strong>the main aspects of Discussion in your group</strong>. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.<br />
</li>
<li>Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why does this Matter to Us?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In the Icebreaker Game, some of you would have difficulty trying to spot the pattern WITHOUT discussing with your friends!</p></li>
<li><p>Others would have perhaps frowned at the slightest whisper in the class, as they were concentrating!</p></li>
<li><p>In the Team Game, you might have realized that each of the 4 teams had members that were different in ONE of the MBTI characteristics! So I had pitted I vs E people; N vs S people; T vs F people, and J vs P people. The tasks allocated to each of you was precisely one to make that <em>dichotomy</em> surface in your discussions. And of course, the documentation of the discussions was far more important than the end results !! ;-D</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So what have learnt then? From the two exercises, we see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reality depends upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view. Note that this is about our <em>cognitive bias</em> that may depend upon our cultural outlook, and our ability to miss things.</li>
<li>It is emphatically not about <u><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/alternative-facts/">alternative facts</a></u> which is arrant nonsense.</li>
<li>We all have our “default modes” for behaviour, that give us a restricted appreciation of the World</li>
<li>As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better.</li>
<li>Comprehending reality better gives a stronger basis for Art/Design <strong>decisions</strong> and plans for action.</li>
</ul>
