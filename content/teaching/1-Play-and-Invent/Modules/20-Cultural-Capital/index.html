<h2>Additional Readings</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Andrea Ovans. (February 27, 2015). <em>Is Innovation More About People or Process?</em>. <u><a href="https://hbr.org/2015/02/is-innovation-more-about-people-or-process" class="uri">https://hbr.org/2015/02/is-innovation-more-about-people-or-process</a></u></p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>The discoveries of yesterday are the truisms of tomorrow, because we can add to our knowledge but cannot subtract from it. When two frames of reference have both become integrated into one it becomes difficult to imagine that previously they existed separately. The synthesis looks deceptively self-evident, and does not betray the imaginative effort needed to put its component parts together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sense, all knowledge seems to be a kind of loss of innocence, a new state being attained from where we cannot go back the old one. This is also similar to the idea of <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence"><strong>Path Dependence</strong></a></u>.</p>
<p>Apropos: the only place I know where we can, and indeed must, undo this momentary(?) tyranny of knowing is in <u><a href="https://youtu.be/ytjvvUrOvHk"><strong>Viterbi decoders for Convolutional Codes</strong></a></u>, but that is <em>another world</em> in itself!!</p>
<p>What do you need to do this? Memory.</p>
