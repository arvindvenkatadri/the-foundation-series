<h2>A Model for Proximity: The Voronoi and the Delaunay Diagrams</h2>
<p>So how do we model “proximity”? Let us take a quick look at this
description of <u><a href="/pdf/Proximity/FollowingtheHerd.pdf"><strong>Predator-Prey
Dynamics.</strong></a></u></p>

<h3>Plotting the Delaunay and Voronoi Diagrams</h3>
<p>So here is an example of a computationally plotted Delaunay
Triangulation and Voronoi Diagram:</p>

<p>How do we plot these diagrams?</p>
<p>We will use this tool:
<u><a href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic"><strong>Geogebra</strong></a></u></p>
<p>Download and install this on your laptops. You can also use it in your
browser <u><a href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en" class="uri">https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en</a></u> and download
the Geogebra (<em>.ggb</em>) files that you create.</p>

<p>Now let us make such a diagram step by step:</p>

to do to plot the Voronoi Diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Exercise 3: With 4 points: <u><a href="/pdf/Proximity/four%20points.ggb">Four Pointer

<li><p>Exercise 4: Let us now add more points. How do we make a multi-point

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Did you see how the Delaunay Triangulation seems to “dislike”
obtuse-angles, and changes the triangulation pattern when a certain
(sum of) angles become more than 180?</li>
<li>Wasn’t that a very Kandinsky-like thing to do, even for an
algorithm?</li>
<li>The Delaunay Triangulation gives us a set of triangular elements
that cover our desired surface</li>
<li>The Voronoi Diagram uses the Delaunay to give us <em>possibly infinite</em>
proximal neighbourhoods.</li>

<h2>Other Distances?</h2>
<div id="hamming-distances" class="section level3">
<h3>Hamming Distances</h3>
<p>We have used the simplest and most common of geometric distances between
entities, the <strong>Euclidean Distance</strong> to model proximity. Are there other
<em>measures of distance</em>?</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you measure distance between <em>digital words</em>? For example
<span class="math inline">\(10010011\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(11011011\)</span>?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Hamming distance</strong> between two equal-length strings of symbols
is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are
different. The symbols may be letters, bits, or decimal digits, among
other possibilities. For example, the Hamming distance between:
“karolin” and “kathrin” is 3. “karolin” and “kerstin” is 3. “kathrin”
and “kerstin” is 4. 0000 and 1111 is 4. 2173896 and 2233796 is 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hamming Distance can be calculated using a logical operation known
as <u><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/ciphers/a/xor-bitwise-operation">“Exclusive-OR” or
“XOR”</a></u>.</p>

<h2>So where are all these Proximities used?</h2>
<div id="proximities-in-the-gps-system" class="section level3">
<h3>Proximities in the GPS System</h3>
<p>The GPS system is all about wanting to know if one is <em>proximate</em> to a
desired landmark! But how does it work?</p>
<p>Based on a measurement of two proximity scores, both electronic. One in
Space and one in Time. Oooh, cryptic, isn’t it? Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Users receive GPS transmissions from more than one satellite (to
improve accuracy; more later).</p></li>
<li><p>Each Satellite is given a <strong>unique digital signature code</strong>, called
its <em>Coarse/Acquisition</em>, or C/A Code.</p></li>
<li><p>This code is a digital one-zero based sequence, which repeats after
a week.</p></li>
<li><p>The code ones and zeroes are called <strong>chips</strong>; the chips are output
by each satellite at a rate of 1.023 MHz. ( i.e. a little faster
than a million chips per second)</p></li>
<li><p>All satellites use an on-board time clock. All satellites are
synchronized and it is the same time on all satellites, regardless
of where they are in the sky.</p></li>
<li><p>A User Receiver cannot understand what the satellite is saying,
UNLESS it removes/wipes off the signature used by the satellite. So
think of this in <strong><em>proximity</em></strong> terms: the user needs to know the
Signature Sequence and also be <strong>in sync aligned</strong> with it, chip for
chip.</p></li>
<li><p>One the signature is removed, what remains is what the satellite is
saying.</p></li>
<li><p>GPS#5 उवाच:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It is 4 PM on my onboard clock”;</li>
<li>“The ionosphere is doing weird things so please include that
weirdness in your position computation etc”;</li>
<li>Other stuff, called the <strong>satellite ephimeris</strong> (which we may
discuss in class)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>But <u><a href="https://youtu.be/YwG4F-16Tno">Houston, we have a problem</a></u>,
but right here on the ground, mercifully. The problem is, wait for it,
<strong>the Speed of Light</strong>. And it is a <strong>good problem to have</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you detect say GPS#5 saying it is 4 PM, that signal came from
GPS#5 to you at the speed of light, so <strong><em>by the time it arrives</em></strong>,
the time on the satellite is already 4PM + 150 microseconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Since different GPS satellites we can see are at different
<strong><em>ranges</em></strong>, we receive different times from 5 different GPS
satellites.</p></li>
<li><p>Then we can set up a set of linear matrix equations in these
variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Received Time” from each satellite (<strong><em>Pseudo-Range</em></strong>)</li>
<li>Long and Lat (called a <strong><em>Position Fix</em></strong>);</li>
<li>Absolute Time (<strong><em>Time Fix</em></strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Which we solve to obtain both Position Fix and Time Fix.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary, the user needs to calculate two proximities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>C/A code proximity</strong>, measured by the Hamming Distance between
the received code and a locally generated C/A code. Which code to
generate locally? We don’t really know, so we generate ~ <em>all</em>.
Huh. And select that C/A code to wipe off which shows good proximity
with received C/A code. (This is called, in telecom language, a
<strong><em>Code Matched Filter</em></strong> and <strong><em>Rake Receiver</em></strong>. Ask me what this
looks like, at your peril.)</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Time Proximity</strong>, by correcting its own local clock to match the
satellite clocks, accurately. (This is called, in telecom language
again, a <strong>Delay-Lock Loop</strong>. Peril again.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Proximity Measurement</h3>

<div class="figcaption">Code Proximity Measure</div>
</div>
<p>In the <span class="citation">@fig-code-autocorr</span> above, the red curve shows the Hamming Distance between a received C/A code, and its locally generated copy. Only when the proximity between them is within one-chip does the measure have any sensible amplitude. (This is called <strong><em>Autocorrelation</em></strong>.)</p>
<p>The blue curve show Hamming Distance proximity between a received C/A code and <strong>any other</strong> C/A code. At no overlap position do these dissimilar codes have a useful proximity measure. (This is known as <strong>Cross-Correlation</strong>).</p>
<p>C/A codes are <strong><em>designed</em></strong> to have that spike-like autocorrelation, and that fuzz like cross-correlation to aid in proximity-based synchronization and code wipe-off.</p>

<h3>A Brief Foray into Cryptography</h3>
<p>In the Sherlock Holmes story,<u><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/108/108-h/108-h.htm#chap03"><strong>The Adventure of the Dancing
Men</strong></a></u>,
a criminal known the one of the characters communicates with her using a
childish/child-like drawing which looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/img01.jpg" /> In this message, each character is a visual
representation, or a substution for, a letter from the alphabet. The
characters with flags are the first letter of a new word. The message is
translated in the story as “Am here, Abe Slaney”.</p>
<p>The entire <strong>code alphabet</strong> is shown in the figure below:
<img src="images/dancing-men-cipher-overview.png" /></p>
<p>This code is a good example of a <u><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/substitution-cipher/"><strong>Substitution
Cipher</strong></a></u> with
non-text substition. See
<u><a href="https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/dancing-men-cipher" class="uri">https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/dancing-men-cipher</a></u> and
<u><a href="https://www.dcode.fr/dancing-men-cipher" class="uri">https://www.dcode.fr/dancing-men-cipher</a></u> for examples where you
can encode and decode your own text, and send them to friends.
😎 😼</p>
<p>The intent behind any substitution cipher is to be create <strong>distance</strong>
from the original message, or characters. The algorithms to encode and
decode uses this idea of <strong>distance</strong> to perform their operations and
are entirely reversible.</p>
