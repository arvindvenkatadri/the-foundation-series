## A Model for Proximity: The Voronoi and the Delaunay Diagrams

So how do we model "proximity"? Let us take a quick look at this
description of <u>[**Predator-Prey
Dynamics.**](/pdf/Proximity/FollowingtheHerd.pdf)</u>

### Plotting the Delaunay and Voronoi Diagrams

So here is an example of a computationally plotted Delaunay
Triangulation and Voronoi Diagram:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.height=6}
set.seed(1963)

x <- runif(n = 30, min = -10,10)
y <- rnorm(n=30, mean = 0, sd = 5)
z <- rpois(30, lambda = 5)
data <- data.frame(x,y,z)
vor <- deldir(x,y)
##
# v <- tile.list(vor)
# base::plot(v, showpoints = TRUE, 
#      col.pts = "red",
#      pch = 18, 
#      border = "green", xlim = c(-20, 20))
##
# del <- deldir(x,y, wl = "tr")
# d <- tile.list(del)
# base::plot(d, showpoints = TRUE, 
#      col.pts = "red",
#      pch = 18, 
#      border = "green", xlim = c(-20, 20))
##
# ggplot(data) +
#   geom_voronoi(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = z), 
#                colour = "green") +
#   geom_point(aes(x,y), colour = "white") +
#   theme_minimal()
##
gf_segment(y1 + y2 ~ x1 + x2, data = vor$delsgs, colour = "green") %>% 
  gf_point(data = data, y ~ x, color = "red", 
           inherit = F,size = 4,
           title = "Delaunay Triangulation") %>%
  gf_refine(coord_fixed()) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())
##
gf_segment(y1 + y2 ~ x1 + x2, data = vor$dirsgs, colour = "purple") %>% 
  gf_point(data = data, y ~ x, color = "red", 
           inherit = F, size = 4,
           title = "Voronoi Diagram") %>%
    gf_refine(coord_fixed()) %>% 
    gf_theme(theme_minimal())
##
gf_segment(y1 + y2 ~ x1 + x2, data = vor$delsgs, colour = "green") %>% 
  gf_segment(y1 + y2 ~ x1 + x2, data = vor$dirsgs, colour = "purple", inherit = F) %>% 
  gf_point(data = data, y ~ x, color = "red", 
           inherit = F,size = 4,
           title = "Delaunay and Voronoi Overlay") %>%
  gf_refine(coord_fixed()) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())

```

How do we plot these diagrams?

We will use this tool:
<u>[**Geogebra**](https://www.geogebra.org/classic)</u>

Download and install this on your laptops. You can also use it in your
browser <u><https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en></u> and download
the Geogebra (*.ggb*) files that you create.

1.  Exercise 1: Let us first see <u>[**Soho with the Voronoi
    Diagram**](/pdf/Proximity/SohoMap.ggb)</u>

Now let us make such a diagram step by step:

1.  Exercise 2: Let us try with just three points and see what we need
    to do to plot the Voronoi Diagram.

2.  Exercise 3: With 4 points: <u>[Four Pointer
    Voronoi](/pdf/Proximity/four%20points.ggb)</u>

3.  Exercise 4: Let us now add more points. How do we make a multi-point
    Voronoi? We need to make a <u>[**"list of points" in
    Geogebra**](/pdf/Proximity/VoronoiLargeNoOfPointsInGeogebra.pdf)</u>

### Discussion

-   Did you see how the Delaunay Triangulation seems to "dislike"
    obtuse-angles, and changes the triangulation pattern when a certain
    (sum of) angles become more than 180?
-   Wasn't that a very Kandinsky-like thing to do, even for an
    algorithm?
-   The Delaunay Triangulation gives us a set of triangular elements
    that cover our desired surface
-   The Voronoi Diagram uses the Delaunay to give us *possibly infinite*
    proximal neighbourhoods.

## Fun Stuff with Geogebra and Voronoi

1.  Predator Prey Movement....

-   Create a set of points in Geogebra.
-   Colour/Shape one of the outermost points as a predator which circles
    the herd.
-   Use the Voronoi diagram to model the *Zone of Danger* for each of
    the animals in the inner herd.
-   Try **Animation** in Geogebra !!

2.  Service Areas with Voronoi

-   Import a 5km \* 5km square of area in your home town, from Google
    Maps, into Geogebra.
-   Locate points of interest, all in one category ( ATMs, Post Offices,
    Hospitals, Police Stations...)
-   Plot the Voronoi Diagram to show the area served by each such
    institution.
-   Calculate the area in Geogebra.
-   Assume a flat population/sqkm and use that to calculate the number
    of people served by each.

**All** of this can be done without leaving Geogebra !!

3.  Voronoi Portraits and Facial Recognition

A. My name is Arnold Schwarzenegger

-   Take a picture of yourself and import it into Geogebra
-   Plot Points on the Portrait such that the main facial features are
    defined.
-   Use a Delaunay Triangulation of these points to create a Portrait.

B. My Face is My Fortune

-   Do the same for a famous person, past or present.
-   Run a small survey in the class to see how many people can recognize
    celebrity!

## Other Distances?

### Hamming Distances

We have used the simplest and most common of geometric distances between
entities, the **Euclidean Distance** to model proximity. Are there other
*measures of distance*?

-   How would you measure distance between *digital words*? For example
    $10010011$ and $11011011$?

> The **Hamming distance** between two equal-length strings of symbols
> is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are
> different. The symbols may be letters, bits, or decimal digits, among
> other possibilities. For example, the Hamming distance between:
> "karolin" and "kathrin" is 3. "karolin" and "kerstin" is 3. "kathrin"
> and "kerstin" is 4. 0000 and 1111 is 4. 2173896 and 2233796 is 3.

The Hamming Distance can be calculated using a logical operation known
as <u>["Exclusive-OR" or
"XOR"](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/ciphers/a/xor-bitwise-operation)</u>.

### Great Circle Distances

How would you measure distance over a *curved surface* such as the
earth?

View the path here: <u><https://www.greatcirclemap.com/></u> Calculate
distances here: <u><https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/calculators></u>

### Taxicab Distances

And if a *man hatta* live in New York?

![](taxicab-manhattan-grid-layout-paths.gif)

![](taxicab-manhattan-grid-taxicab-distance.png)

We will use the Euclidean and maybe other concepts of distance when we
get into our Machine Learning models!

## So where are all these Proximities used?

### Proximities in the GPS System

The GPS system is all about wanting to know if one is *proximate* to a
desired landmark! But how does it work?

Based on a measurement of two proximity scores, both electronic. One in
Space and one in Time. Oooh, cryptic, isn't it? Here is how it works:

-   Users receive GPS transmissions from more than one satellite (to
    improve accuracy; more later).

-   Each Satellite is given a **unique digital signature code**, called
    its *Coarse/Acquisition*, or C/A Code.

-   This code is a digital one-zero based sequence, which repeats after
    a week.

-   The code ones and zeroes are called **chips**; the chips are output
    by each satellite at a rate of 1.023 MHz. ( i.e. a little faster
    than a million chips per second)

-   All satellites use an on-board time clock. All satellites are
    synchronized and it is the same time on all satellites, regardless
    of where they are in the sky.

-   A User Receiver cannot understand what the satellite is saying,
    UNLESS it removes/wipes off the signature used by the satellite. So
    think of this in ***proximity*** terms: the user needs to know the
    Signature Sequence and also be **in sync aligned** with it, chip for
    chip.

-   One the signature is removed, what remains is what the satellite is
    saying.

-   GPS#5 उवाच:

    -   "It is 4 PM on my onboard clock";
    -   "The ionosphere is doing weird things so please include that
        weirdness in your position computation etc";
    -   Other stuff, called the **satellite ephimeris** (which we may
        discuss in class)

But <u>[Houston, we have a problem](https://youtu.be/YwG4F-16Tno)</u>,
but right here on the ground, mercifully. The problem is, wait for it,
**the Speed of Light**. And it is a **good problem to have**.

-   When you detect say GPS#5 saying it is 4 PM, that signal came from
    GPS#5 to you at the speed of light, so ***by the time it arrives***,
    the time on the satellite is already 4PM + 150 microseconds.

-   Since different GPS satellites we can see are at different
    ***ranges***, we receive different times from 5 different GPS
    satellites.

-   Then we can set up a set of linear matrix equations in these
    variables:

    -   "Received Time" from each satellite (***Pseudo-Range***)
    -   Long and Lat (called a ***Position Fix***);
    -   Absolute Time (***Time Fix***)

-   Which we solve to obtain both Position Fix and Time Fix.

So in summary, the user needs to calculate two proximities:

-   A **C/A code proximity**, measured by the Hamming Distance between
    the received code and a locally generated C/A code. Which code to
    generate locally? We don't really know, so we generate \~ *all*.
    Huh. And select that C/A code to wipe off which shows good proximity
    with received C/A code. (This is called, in telecom language, a
    ***Code Matched Filter*** and ***Rake Receiver***. Ask me what this
    looks like, at your peril.)

-   A **Time Proximity**, by correcting its own local clock to match the
    satellite clocks, accurately. (This is called, in telecom language
    again, a **Delay-Lock Loop**. Peril again.)

### Code Proximity Measurement

![Code Proximity Measure](/images/autocorr.jpeg){#fig-code-proximity}

In the figure above, the red curve shows the Hamming Distance between a received C/A code, and its locally generated copy. Only when the proximity between them is within one-chip does the measure have any sensible amplitude. (This is called ***Autocorrelation***.)

The blue curve show Hamming Distance proximity between a received C/A code and **any other** C/A code. At no overlap position do these dissimilar codes have a useful proximity measure. (This is known as **Cross-Correlation**). 

C/A codes are ***designed*** to have that spike-like autocorrelation, and that fuzz like cross-correlation to aid in proximity-based synchronization and code wipe-off. 



### A Brief Foray into Cryptography

In the Sherlock Holmes story,<u>[**The Adventure of the Dancing
Men**](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/108/108-h/108-h.htm#chap03)</u>,
a criminal known the one of the characters communicates with her using a
childish/child-like drawing which looks like this:

![](images/img01.jpg) In this message, each character is a visual
representation, or a substution for, a letter from the alphabet. The
characters with flags are the first letter of a new word. The message is
translated in the story as "Am here, Abe Slaney".

The entire **code alphabet** is shown in the figure below:
![](images/dancing-men-cipher-overview.png)

This code is a good example of a <u>[**Substitution
Cipher**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/substitution-cipher/)</u> with
non-text substition. See
<u><https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/dancing-men-cipher></u> and
<u><https://www.dcode.fr/dancing-men-cipher></u> for examples where you
can encode and decode your own text, and send them to friends.
`r emoji::emoji("sunglasses")` `r emoji("smirk_cat")`

The intent behind any substitution cipher is to be create **distance**
from the original message, or characters. The algorithms to encode and
decode uses this idea of **distance** to perform their operations and
are entirely reversible.

## Painting with Proximity/Distance

Well, all right, all right, tech is fine. Can we use the idea of
Proximity to create **art**? Well, we are not Kandinsky, but we can try.
Here goes:

-   Fire up the Strava app, or equivalent, on your phones.
-   Walk out into the college campus, preferably under open sky.
-   With the app on, try to create a figure <u>[like
    this](https://gpsart.info/en/gpsart-en/nowhow1-en/)</u>
-   Share the image with your friend!
