## Ventura Garcia Calderon

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Ventura_Garcia_Calderon.jpg/330px-Ventura_Garcia_Calderon.jpg)

> Ventura García Calderón (1886–1959) was a Peruvian man of letters and
> a diplomat who was at the center of the hispanophone community in
> Paris in the first half of the twentieth century. Known as a proponent
> of Spanish American literature, García Calderón achieved a global
> celebrity for his dramatic, colorful, and ironic short stories. These
> stories, published in both Spanish and French, feature a raw depiction
> of reality, a strong sense of retributive justice, and a sympathy for
> the marginalized people that characterize European Naturalism. García
> Calderón adapted this style to advance his goal of providing European
> readers with an authentic understanding of Peru and Spanish America,
> thus replacing the voyeuristic and patronizing notion of the "exotic"
> inherited from literary romanticism and nineteenth-century travel
> writers.

> The construction of García Calderón's stories was subversive and
> destabilized the widespread notion of Peru held by European critics
> and readers. While international critics during the author's lifetime
> unanimously praised García Calderón's fiction as well as his essays
> that theorize the transformation and renaissance of Spanish language
> and literature by americano writers, scholars since the 1960s have
> largely misunderstood his reformative project.

> Leonard Nimoy, who died February 27,2015 at the age of 83, was beloved
> by fans for his distinctive portrayal of Mr. Spock on Star Trek. Those
> fans may not have known that Nimoy, through his work as a
> photographer, also championed women who did not conform to Hollywood's
> ideal of physical perfection. [see also
> <u><http://mashable.com/2015/02/26/body-positivity-get-involved></u> In
> 2007, Nimoy published *The Full Body Project*, a collection of photos
> featuring nude women of many shapes and sizes. Nimoy's previous book
> of photographs captured images of nude women as well, though the
> models' slim bodies hewed closely to the conventional standards of
> beauty. The inspiration for *The Fully Body Project* struck when a
> full-figured woman approached Nimoy and asked if he might photograph
> her and her friends.
