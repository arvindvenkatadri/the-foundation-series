# Introduction

We saw from the diagram created by Allen Downey that *there is only one
test*! We will now use this philosophy to develop a technique that
allows us to mechanize several *Statistical Models* in that way, with
nearly identical code.

We will use two packages in R, `mosaic` and the relatively new `infer`
package, to develop our intuition for what are called **permutation**
based statistical tests.

# Testing for Two or More Proportions

Let us try a dataset with Qualitative / Categorical data. This is the
General Social Survey GSS dataset, and we have people with different
levels of `Education` stating their opinion on the `Death Penalty`. We
want to know if these two Categorical variables have a correlation, i.e.
can the opinions in favour of the `Death Penalty` be explained by the
`Education` level?

Since data is Categorical ( both variables ), we need to take `counts`
in a table, and then implement a `chi-square test`. In the test, we will
permute the `Education` variable to see if we can see how significant
its *effect size* is.

```{r}

data(GSS2002)
inspect(GSS2002)

```


Note how *all* variables are Categorical !! `Education` has five `levels`:

```{r}

GSS2002 %>% count(Education)
GSS2002 %>% count(DeathPenalty)

```

Let us drop NA entries in `Education` and `Death Penalty`. And set up a table for the chi-square test.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

gss2002 <- GSS2002 %>% 
  dplyr::select(Education, DeathPenalty) %>% 
  tidyr::drop_na(., c(Education, DeathPenalty))
dim(gss2002)

gss_summary <- gss2002 %>%
  mutate(
    Education = factor(
      Education,
      levels = c("Bachelors", "Graduate", "Jr Col", "HS", "Left HS"),
      labels = c("Bachelors", "Graduate", "Jr Col", "HS", "Left HS")
    ),
    DeathPenalty = as.factor(DeathPenalty)
  ) %>%
  group_by(Education, DeathPenalty) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>% # This is good for a chisq test
  
  # Add two more columns to facilitate mosaic/Marrimekko Plot
  # 
  mutate(edu_count = sum(count), 
         edu_prop = count / sum(count)) %>%
  ungroup() 

gss_summary

```




## Table Plots {#sec-table-plots .tabset .tabset-pills}

We can plot a heatmap-like `mosaic chart` for this table.



### Using `ggplot` {.active }

```{r warning=FALSE}
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19233365/how-to-create-a-marimekko-mosaic-plot-in-ggplot2

ggplot(data = gss_summary, aes( x = Education, y = edu_prop)) +
  
  geom_bar(aes(width = edu_count, fill = DeathPenalty), 
           stat = "identity", 
           position = "fill", 
           colour = "black") +
  
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(edu_prop)), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +


# if labels are desired
 facet_grid(~ Education, scales = "free_x", space = "free_x") + 
  theme(scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdYlGn")) + 
  # theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(0, "npc")) + # if no spacing preferred between bars
  theme_void() 

```



### Using `ggmosaic`

```{r mosaic-plot,warning=FALSE}
#library(ggmosaic)

ggplot(data = gss2002) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(DeathPenalty, Education), fill = DeathPenalty))

```

##  {.unnumbered}

### Observed Statistic: the X^2 metric

When there are multiple proportions involved, the X^2 test is what is
used.

Let us now perform the base `chisq test`: We need a `table` and then the
`chisq` test:

```{r}

gss_table <- tally(DeathPenalty ~ Education, data = gss2002)
gss_table

# Get the observed chi-square statistic
observedChi2 <- mosaic::chisq(tally(DeathPenalty ~ Education, data = gss2002))
observedChi2

# Actual chi-square test
stats::chisq.test(tally(DeathPenalty ~ Education, data = gss2002))

```

What would our Hypotheses be?

\$\$ H_0: Education Does Not affect Votes on Death Penalty\\\
H_a: Education affects Votes on Death Penalty\

\$\$

We should now repeat the test with permutations on `Education`:

```{r}

null_chisq <- do(10000) * chisq.test(tally(DeathPenalty ~ shuffle(Education), data = gss2002))

head(null_chisq)

gf_histogram( ~ X.squared, data = null_chisq) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = observedChi2, color = "red")

prop1(~ X.squared >= observedChi2, data = null_chisq)

```

The `p-value` is well below our threshold of \$0.05%, so we would
conclude that `Education` has a significant effect on `DeathPenalty`
opinion!

## Conclusion
