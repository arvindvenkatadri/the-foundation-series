# Setup the Packages

```{r setup, message=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse) # includes ggplot for plotting

library(ggbump) # Bump Charts

library(ggiraphExtra) # Radar, Spine, Donut and Donut-Pie combo charts !!

# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ricardo-bion/ggradar")
library(ggradar) # Radar Plots

```

# What graphs are we going to see today?

When we wish to compare the size of things and rank them, there are
quite a few ways to do it.

Bar Charts and Lollipop Charts are immediately obvious when we wish to
rank things on *one* aspect or parameter.

When we wish to rank the same set of objects against **multiple**
aspects or parameters, then we can use Bump Charts and Radar Charts.

## Lollipop Charts

```{r}
# Sample data set
set.seed(1)
df1 <- tibble(x = LETTERS[1:10],
                 y = sample(20:35, 10, replace = TRUE))
df1

ggplot(df1) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, xend = x, y = 0, yend = y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, colour = x), size = 5)

```

We can flip this horizontally *and* reorder the $x$ categories in order
of decreasing ( or increasing ) $y$, using `forcats::fct_reorder`:

```{r}

ggplot(df1) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = fct_reorder(x, -y), # in decreasing order of y
                   xend = fct_reorder(x, -y), 
                   y = 0, 
                   yend = y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, colour = x), size = 5) +
  coord_flip() + 
  xlab("Group") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Bump Charts

Bump Charts track the ranking of several objects based on *other*
parameters, such as time/month or even category. We can think of this a
a *Basis* for ranking. For instance, what is the opinion score of a set
of products across various categories of users:

```{r}
year <- rep(2019:2021, 4)
position <- c(4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3)
product <- c("A", "A", "A",
            "B", "B", "B", 
            "C", "C", "C",
            "D", "D", "D")

df2 <- tibble(x = year,
                 y = position,
                 group = product)

df2

```

We need to use a new package called, what else, `ggbump` to create our
`Bump Charts`:

```{r bump-1}
library(ggbump)

ggplot(df2) +
  geom_bump(aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = group), size = 6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Time") +
  ylab("Product Rank") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu") # Change Colour Scale

```

We can add labels along the "bump lines" and remove the legend
altogether:

```{r bump-2}

ggplot(df2) +
  geom_bump(aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = group), size = 6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdBu") + # Change Colour Scale
# Same as before up to her
# Add the labels at start and finish

  geom_text(data = df2 %>% filter(x == min(x)),
            aes(x = x - 0.1, label = group, y = y),
            size = 5, hjust = 1) +
  geom_text(data = df2 %>% filter(x == max(x)),
            aes(x = x + 0.1, label = group, y = y),
            size = 5, hjust = 0) +
  xlab("Time") +
  ylab("Product Rank") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Radar Charts

The same data can be plotted on a roughly circular set of axes, with the
radial distance defining the rank against each axes.

Of course, we can use `ggradar`, which is at this time (Feb 2023) a
development version and not yet part of CRAN. We will still try it, and
another package `ggiraphExtra` which IS a part of CRAN.

```{r using ggradar}

#library(ggradar)

set.seed(4)
df3 <- tibble(Product = c("G1", "G2", "G3"),
              Power = runif(3), 
              Cost = runif(3),
              Harmony = runif(3),
              Style = runif(3),
              Size = runif(3),
              Manufacturability = runif(3),
              Durability = runif(3),
              Universality = runif(3))
df3

ggradar::ggradar(plot.data = df3,
                 axis.label.size = 3, # Titles of Params
                 grid.label.size = 4, # Score Values/Circles
                 group.point.size = 3,# Product Points Sizes
                 group.line.width = 1, # Product Line Widths
                 fill = TRUE, # fill the radar polygons
                 fill.alpha = 0.3, # Not too dark, Arvind
                 legend.title = "Product") +
  theme_void()

```

From the `ggiraphExtra` website:

> Package `ggiraphExtra` contains many useful functions for exploratory
> plots. These functions are made by both 'ggplot2' and 'ggiraph'
> packages. You can make a static ggplot or an interactive ggplot by
> setting the parameter interactive=TRUE.

```{r using ggiraphExtra}
# library(ggiraphExtra)

ggiraphExtra::ggRadar(data = df3,
        aes(colour = Product),
        rescale = FALSE,
          )  + # recale = TRUE makes it look different...try!!
  theme_minimal()


```

Both render very similar-looking radar charts and the syntax is not too
intimidating!!

## Your Turn

1.  Take the `HELPrct` dataset from our well used `mosaicData` package.
    Plot ranking charts using each of the public health issues that you
    can see in that dataset. What choice will you make for the the axes?
2.  Try the `SaratogaHouses` dataset also from `mosaicData`.
