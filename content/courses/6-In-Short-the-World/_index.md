## Introduction

Several Short Stories from different parts of the World will be read in detail. The following aspects of the stories shall be discussed in class: 

• The story/sequence, the interesting events  
• Setting  
• The characters, their voices, identity, emotions, impressions  
• The authenticity of the speaker/narrator and author  
• Said and unsaid  
• Language construction that seems unique to the location of the story; Peculiar turns of phrase; caricature and cliché.  
• Cultural, local, or historical references to places, people, events  
• Affinities with our own culture and languages; memories  
• Large themes that the story seems to address  

A video or a song will be also played wherever possible to bring in a multi-sensorial  appreciation of the ideas from the story. The unit will also include exposure to the use of open-source technological tools such as Calibre (e-Book Library Manager), the Hemingway App for improved writing and Browser plug-ins to foster the reading habit.

The students will be required to do:  
a) A Reflective Piece of Writing about the Story that was read in class.  
b) A Creative Piece of Writing on a choice of topics to be announced after reading each story in class.
