## Maxim Gorky

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Maxim_Gorky.jpg)

> Maxim Gorky (born March 16 [March 28, New Style], 1868, Nizhny
> Novgorod, Russia—died June 14, 1936) Russian short-story writer and
> novelist who first attracted attention with his naturalistic and
> sympathetic stories of tramps and social outcasts and later wrote
> other stories, novels, and plays, including his famous The Lower
> Depths.

> (He) was a Russian author considered the father of Soviet
> revolutionary literature and founder of the doctrine of socialist
> realism. After having a difficult childhood, he roamed across the
> Russian empire, frequently changing jobs for about fifteen years
> before he became a successful writer. The experiences he had during
> those fifteen years deeply influenced his writing. Initially, he wrote
> stories mainly based on the lives of tramps and social outcasts, and
> he became known for his naturalistic style of writing. One of his
> greatest works is ‘The Mother,’ which Lenin praised as “a very timely
> book.”

> Gorky was deeply associated with fellow Russian writers, Anton Chekhov
> and Leo Tolstoy and later wrote memoirs on them. Gorky was not only a
> great writer but also an influential figure in the political thinking.
> He was active with the emerging Marxist social-democrat movement.
> Initially a Bolshevik supporter, he became a critic when Vladimir
> Lenin seized power. However, later Gorky served as a Soviet advocate
> and headed the Union of Soviet Writers. His life was marked with a
> number of politically forced and sometimes self-imposed exiles.

> He was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
