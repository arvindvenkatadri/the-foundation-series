<h2>Maxim Gorky</h2>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Maxim_Gorky.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maxim Gorky (born March 16, 1868, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia—died June
14, 1936) Russian short-story writer and novelist who first attracted
attention with his naturalistic and sympathetic stories of tramps and
social outcasts and later wrote other stories, novels, and plays,
including his famous The Lower Depths.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(He) was a Russian author considered the father of Soviet
revolutionary literature and founder of the doctrine of socialist
realism. After having a difficult childhood, he roamed across the
Russian empire, frequently changing jobs for about fifteen years
before he became a successful writer. The experiences he had during
those fifteen years deeply influenced his writing. Initially, he wrote
stories mainly based on the lives of tramps and social outcasts, and
he became known for his naturalistic style of writing. One of his
greatest works is ‘The Mother,’ which Lenin praised as “a very timely
book.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gorky was deeply associated with fellow Russian writers, Anton Chekhov
and Leo Tolstoy and later wrote memoirs on them. Gorky was not only a
great writer but also an influential figure in the political thinking.
He was active with the emerging Marxist social-democrat movement.
Initially a Bolshevik supporter, he became a critic when Vladimir
Lenin seized power. However, later Gorky served as a Soviet advocate
and headed the Union of Soviet Writers. His life was marked with a
number of politically forced and sometimes self-imposed exiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Death and Life of Great American Cities is a 1961 book by writer
and activist Jane Jacobs. The book is a critique of 1950s urban
planning policy, which it holds responsible for the decline of many
city neighborhoods in the United States. The book is Jacobs’
best-known and most influential work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert Kanigel’s biography of Jacobs is called <strong>Eyes on the Street</strong>,
a phrase that Jacobs herself coined about the crucial importance of a
vibrant street life to neighborhood safety and community.</p>
