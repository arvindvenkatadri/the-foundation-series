## Ivan Bunin

![](bunin.jpg)

> IVAN BUNIN, the first Russian writer to win the Nobel Prize (1931),
> was born in 1870 to an aristocratic family in Vorornezh. After
> attending the University of Moscow briefly, he brought out his first
> book, a volume of verse. For this and his realistic accounts of the
> decay of the Russian nobility, he was awarded the Pushkin Prize for
> Literature and elected to the Russian Academy. He fled to western
> Europe, following the Revolution, and lived mainly in Paris, sometimes
> nearly destitute, until his death at the age of eightythree. His study
> of the dying patriarchy among Russian peasants raises him into the
> front rank of European novelists, but his present reputation rests on
> his short stories, in such collections as The Gentleman from San
> Francisco and The Grammar of Love. In many of his stories he contrasts
> the transitoriness of human life with the endurance of beauty and
> nature. Somerset Maugham has called "Sunstroke" one of the world's
> best stories.

> Gurov is relieved when she goes. At home in Moscow, he is surprised
> find that he does not forget her quickly. Instead, he misses her more
