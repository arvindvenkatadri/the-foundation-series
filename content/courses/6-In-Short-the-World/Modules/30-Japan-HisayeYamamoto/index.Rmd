## Hisaye Yamamoto

![](Hisaye-Yamamoto.jpeg)

From <https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Hisaye_Yamamoto/>

> A Southern California <u>[Nisei](https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Nisei/)</u>
> writer of short stories, Hisaye Yamamoto (1921â€“2011) was among the
> first Japanese American writers to win national renown after World War
> II. Yamamoto's upbringing in an immigrant farming community and her
> incarceration in a World War II U.S. government prison camp formed the
> basis for some of her best-known stories, notable for their sensitive
> portrayal of the emotionally and artistically constricted lives of
> <u>[Issei](https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Issei/)</u> women and
> intergenerational family dynamics. Oblique, often deadpan in delivery
> and told with quiet humor and bracing candor, they reveal the love
> affairs, madness, psychic and physical brutality that lay beneath the
> placid surface of Issei and Nisei life. The subject matter, precision
> and grace of Yamamoto's works have led critics to compare her to short
> story masters Katherine Mansfield, Flannery O'Connor, and Grace Paley.
