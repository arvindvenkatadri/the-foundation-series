> Leonard Nimoy, who died February 27,2015 at the age of 83, was beloved by fans for his distinctive portrayal of Mr. Spock on Star Trek. Those fans may not have known that Nimoy, through his work as a photographer, also championed women who did not conform to Hollywood's ideal of physical perfection. [seealso url="http://mashable.com/2015/02/26/body-positivity-get-involved/"] In 2007, Nimoy published The Full Body Project, a collection of photos featuring nude women of many shapes and sizes. Nimoy's previous book of photographs captured images of nude women as well, though the models' slim bodies hewed closely to the conventional standards of beauty. The inspiration for The Fully Body Project struck when a full-figured woman approached Nimoy and asked if he might photograph her and her friends.

Listen to Leonard Nimoy discuss this project on NPR:
