> V.S. Pritchett (1900–1997)was the best short story writer in English during the twentieth century. There should be no argument about this. He was born in 1900 and died ninety-seven years later having written two brilliant memoirs – A Cab at the Door and Midnight Oil – and several excellent biographies, including Chekhov. Chatto & Windus published his Collected Short Stories and Collected Essays in 1991, and it says something about our culture that neither are still in print.  
- David Miller, *That Glimpse of Truth*


> VS Pritchett (1900-97) was a brilliant pen-driving machine for a great deal of the century in which he lived. (He always wrote with a pen, in difficult, crabbed writing, which was patiently typed by his wife Dorothy, and then further embellished in spidery trails by VSP.) He was a prolific novelist, short-story writer, essayist, reviewer, travel writer, biographer and autobiographer. Increasingly in later life a sitter on literary committees, he must have grown tired of being be-laurelled with the "man of letters" wreath. He ended up with a knighthood, and then a huge swath of reverential and affectionate obituaries. He was much loved.
