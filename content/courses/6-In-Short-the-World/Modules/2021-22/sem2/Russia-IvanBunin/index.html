<h2>Ivan Bunin</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>IVAN BUNIN, the first Russian writer to win the Nobel Prize (1931), was born in 1870
to an aristocratic family in Vorornezh. After attending the University of Moscow briefly,
he brought out his first book, a volume of verse. For this and his realistic accounts of the
decay of the Russian nobility, he was awarded the Pushkin Prize for Literature and
elected to the Russian Academy. He fled to western Europe, following the Revolution,
and lived mainly in Paris, sometimes nearly destitute, until his death at the age of eightythree. His study of the dying patriarchy among Russian peasants raises him into the front
rank of European novelists, but his present reputation rests on his short stories, in such
collections as The Gentleman from San Francisco and The Grammar of Love. In many
of his stories he contrasts the transitoriness of human life with the endurance of beauty
and nature. Somerset Maugham has called “Sunstroke” one of the world’s best stories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chekhov’s “The Lady with the Dog”and Bunin’s “A Sunstroke” have much in common, are frequently mentioned in connection with each other, and lend themselves to comparison. By discerning what features of the stories are alike and unlike one can learn much about the overall similarities and differences of the authors.
The plots of both stories are familiar. “The Lady with the
Dog” is about Dmitry Dmitrich Gurov, a banker from Moscow,
not yet forty, married, and the father of three children, and Anna
Sergeevna von Dideritz, who has married two years before and now
lives in the provincial city of S. They meet in Yalta, where they
are spending their vacations alone. Soon they have an affair. De-
spite qualms on Anna’s part, they are fairly happy, but Gurov is
relieved when she goes. At home in Moscow, he is surprised find that he does not forget her quickly. Instead, he misses her
more and more and decides to go to S. to see her. She is surprised
but admits that she has thought of him often and arranges to visit
him occasionally in Moscow. On her visits, they meet in her hotel
room. Although they find some happiness, they realize that the
most difficult part of their affair is just beginning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A Sunstroke” is about a lieutenant and a young married
woman, both of them anonymous, who meet on a Volga river boat.
They are immediately drawn to each other and agree to get off at
a small town, where they spend the night. When the woman leaves
the next morning, the lieutenant does not mind her going; but
later in the day he realizes that he misses her desperately. He can-
not go after her because she has not told him her name. He tries
unsuccessfully in various ways to overcome his sense of loss, and,
when he takes the boat that evening, he feels that he has grown
ten years older.</p>
