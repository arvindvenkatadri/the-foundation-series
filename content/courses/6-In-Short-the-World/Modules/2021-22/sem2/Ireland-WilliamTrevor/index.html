<p>Quoted from the <u><a href="https://lithub.com/"><strong>LitHub Website</strong></a></u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of his stories that has always spoken to me is “A Choice of Butchers.” Reading it again, I prepared myself in advance for the emotional impact it would have on me, only to experience its tragic force more acutely. He handles the intersection of childhood with the adult world so beautifully. To me this is a story both about the loss of innocence and, at the same time, the ongoing state of innocence that can betray us when we are young.
I cherish the dreary details of the house, the oatmeal wallpaper, the way he describes domestic spaces and habits, and people’s physical traits. And that uncommon, perfect word at the end to describe the father: “rumbustiousness.” The story is layered and ambiguous, elegiac, brilliantly understated, impossible not to read in one sitting. It articulates the terrifying resentment, disappointment, and anger we can feel towards our parents, and the confusion and distress evoked by those very feelings.</p>
