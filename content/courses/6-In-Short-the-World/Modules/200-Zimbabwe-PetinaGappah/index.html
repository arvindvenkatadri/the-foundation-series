<h3>Song for the Story!</h3>
<p>Billy Joel’s <em>Allentown</em> from his album <em>The Nylon Curtain</em>:<br />
&gt; About Allentown</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Allentown” is a song by American singer Billy Joel, which was the lead track on Joel’s The Nylon Curtain (1982) album, accompanied by a conceptual music video. Upon its release, and especially in subsequent years, “Allentown” emerged as an anthem of blue-collar America, representing both the aspirations and frustrations of America’s working class in the late 20th century.</p>

<p>Well we’re living here in Allentown<br />
And they’re closing all the factories down<br />
Out in Bethlehem they’re killing time<br />
Filling out forms<br />
Standing in line<br />
Well our fathers fought the Second World War<br />
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore<br />
Met our mothers in the USO<br />
Asked them to dance<br />
Danced with them slow<br />
And we’re living here in Allentown<br />
</p>
<p>But the restlessness was handed down<br />
And it’s getting very hard to stay<br />
</p>
<p>Well we’re waiting here in Allentown<br />
For the Pennsylvania we never found<br />
For the promises our teachers gave<br />
If we worked hard<br />
If we behaved<br />
</p>
<p>So the graduations hang on the wall<br />
But they never really helped us at all<br />
No they never taught us what was real<br />
Iron and coal<br />
And chromium steel<br />
And we’re waiting here in Allentown<br />
</p>
<p>But they’ve taken all the coal from the ground<br />
And the union people crawled away<br />
</p>
<p>Every child has a pretty good shot<br />
To get at least as far as their old man got<br />
But something happened on the way to that place<br />
They threw an American flag in our face<br />
</p>
<p>Well I’m living here in Allentown<br />
And it’s hard to keep a good man down<br />
But I won’t be giving up today<br />
</p>
<p>And we’re living here in Allentown<br />
