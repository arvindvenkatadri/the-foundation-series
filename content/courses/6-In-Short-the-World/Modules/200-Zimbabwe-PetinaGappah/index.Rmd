### Song for the Story!

Billy Joel's *Allentown* from his 1982 album *The Nylon Curtain*:   
> About Allentown

>"Allentown" is a song by American singer Billy Joel, which was the lead track on Joel's The Nylon Curtain (1982) album, accompanied by a conceptual music video. Upon its release, and especially in subsequent years, "Allentown" emerged as an anthem of blue-collar America, representing both the aspirations and frustrations of America's working class in the late 20th century.

Well we're living here in Allentown\
And they're closing all the factories down\
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time\
Filling out forms\
Standing in line\
Well our fathers fought the Second World War\
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore\
Met our mothers in the USO\
Asked them to dance\
Danced with them slow\
And we're living here in Allentown\

But the restlessness was handed down\
And it's getting very hard to stay\

Well we're waiting here in Allentown\
For the Pennsylvania we never found\
For the promises our teachers gave\
If we worked hard\
If we behaved\

So the graduations hang on the wall\
But they never really helped us at all\
No they never taught us what was real\
Iron and coal\
And chromium steel\
And we're waiting here in Allentown\

But they've taken all the coal from the ground\
And the union people crawled away\

Every child has a pretty good shot\
To get at least as far as their old man got\
But something happened on the way to that place\
They threw an American flag in our face\

Well I'm living here in Allentown\
And it's hard to keep a good man down\
But I won't be giving up today\

And we're living here in Allentown\
