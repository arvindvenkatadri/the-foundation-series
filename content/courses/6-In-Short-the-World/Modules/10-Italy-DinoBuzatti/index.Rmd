> Dino was a curious man, fascinated by news. He looked to the future

> opposite was open to change. Sometimes, even, he predicted them, as he

> "teletini", he had imagined diffusion and use. This is why the new
> technologies that have enriched our lives today would also enrich its
> own. And Dino would have fun surfing the Internet, tweeting,
> photographing on Instagram. For this reason he would be proud of "his"
> site which is now beginning to take its first steps.\

| Kaanton se kheench ke yeh aanchal             | After pulling my dress out of thorns            |
| Todke bandhan baandhi payal                   | After breaking the anklets of vows              |
| Ho koi na roko dil ki udaan ko                | Please no one stop the flight of the heart      |
| Dil woh chala aa aa aa                        | There goes my heart flying...                   |
| ---------------                               | ---------------                                 |
| Aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hai                 | Today, I have a desire to live again            |
| Aaj phir marne ka irada hai                   | Today, I have an intention to die again!        |
| Aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hai                 | Today, I have a desire to live again            |
| Aaj phir marne ka irada hai                   | Today, I have an intention to die again!        |

| Apne hi bas mein nahi main(2)                 | I don't have any control over myself            |
| Dil hai kahin toh hoon kahin main(2)          | My heart is somewhere and I'm somewhere else    |
| Ho jaane kya paake meri zindagi ne            | I don't know what my life has attained          |
| Hanskar kaha ha ha ha                         | But it says this laughingly                     |

| Main hoon gubaar ya toofan hoon(2)            | Am I intoxicated or am I a storm                |
| Koi bataye main kahan hoon(2)                 | Please someone tell me where am I               |
| Ho dar hai safar mein kahin kho na jaaon main | I'm scared that I might get lost in the journey |
| Rasta naya aa aa aa                           | As these roads are new for me                   |

| Kal ke andheron se nikal ke(2)                | After coming out from the darkness of yesterday |
| Dekha hai aankhen malte malte(2)              | I've seen this rubbing my eyes                  |
| Ho phool hi phool zindagi bahaar hai          | There is spring and flowers everywhere          |
| Tay kar liya aa aa aa                         | Hence I've decided that...                      |
