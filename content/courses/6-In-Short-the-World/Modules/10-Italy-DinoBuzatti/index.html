<blockquote>
<p>Dino was a curious man, fascinated by news. He looked to the future
with passion and interest, and although it is often believed the
opposite was open to change. Sometimes, even, he predicted them, as he
did with the cell phones of which in a story, baptizing them
“teletini”, he had imagined diffusion and use. This is why the new
technologies that have enriched our lives today would also enrich its
own. And Dino would have fun surfing the Internet, tweeting,
photographing on Instagram. For this reason he would be proud of “his”
site which is now beginning to take its first steps.<br />
