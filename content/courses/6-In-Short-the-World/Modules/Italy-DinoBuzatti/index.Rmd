> Dino was a curious man, fascinated by news. He looked to the future with passion and interest, and although it is often believed the opposite was open to change. Sometimes, even, he predicted them, as he did with the cell phones of which in a story, baptizing them "teletini", he had imagined diffusion and use.
This is why the new technologies that have enriched our lives today would also enrich its own. And Dino would have fun surfing the Internet, tweeting, photographing on Instagram. For this reason he would be proud of "his" site which is now beginning to take its first steps.
