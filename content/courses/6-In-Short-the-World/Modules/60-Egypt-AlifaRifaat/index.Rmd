## Alifa Rifaat

![](AlifaRifaat.png)

From the book blurb:

> “More convincingly than any other woman writing in Arabic today, Alifa
> Rifaat lifts the veil on what it means to be a woman living within a
> traditional Muslim society.” So states the translator’s foreword to
> this collection of the Egyptian author’s best short stories. Rifaat
> (1930–1996) did not go to university, spoke only Arabic, and seldom
> traveled abroad. This virtual immunity from Western influence lends a
> special authenticity to her direct yet sincere accounts of death,
> sexual fulfillment, the lives of women in purdah, and the frustrations
> of everyday life in a male-dominated Islamic environment. Translated
> from the Arabic by Denys Johnson-Davies
> <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/18/denys-johnson-davies-obituary>,
> the collection admits the reader into a hidden private world,
> regulated by the call of the mosque, but often full of profound
> anguish and personal isolation. Badriyya’s despairing anger at her
> deceitful husband, for example, or the haunting melancholy of “At the
> Time of the Jasmine,” are treated with a sensitivity to the discipline
> and order of Islam.

| Koi sune ya na sune, kahatee rahatee hai             | Whether anyone is listening or not, they keep telling the story, |
| Kuchh likh ke aur, kuchh jubanee                     | Some Written, and Sometimes by speaking out                      |

| Jahaan ruke aansu, waheen puree ho gayee             | Whenever the tears stop, that is where the story stops too,      |
| Hai toh nayee fir bhi, hain puranee                  | It is new but its old at the same time                           |

| Ek khatm ho toh, dusaree raat aa jatee hai(2)        | As one night passes, it is time for the other night,             |
| Hothhon pe fir bhulee hui, bat aa jatee hai          | And those forgotten words cross my lips                          |
| Do naino kee hain yeh kahanee                        | That is the story of the two eyes!                               |
| thoda sa badal, thoda sa panee aur ek kahanee        | some clouds, some water, and a story                             |

## Writing Prompts

1.  Contemplate your life, and demise, and write a Will. Dwell on
    relationships and not merely on (imaginary) opulence/ property.
2.  Your Friend is Blind.
3.  A Child discovers a piece of Family History.
