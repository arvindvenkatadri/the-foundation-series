# Abstract

This Unit takes students along a beginner’s journey into Digital Humanities. 
Data, maps, networks that connect individuals and nations, and networks on maps are the main ideas of this Unit. Maps and Networks from Domains such as History, Urban Development, and Literature are examined from a “Human Experience” point of view. Spatial and Temporal patterns on these real-world and imaginary landscapes are detected and correlated with our own experience and understanding. 

Data Structures that help create such visuals will be examined in detail. Spatial, Network, and Spatial-Network datasets shall be examined in the R language and shall be plotted in various ways, appreciating the underlying quantitative and qualitative attributes, and how these can be used to create a complex experience on the visualizations. Other experiences shall also be created using apps such as Google Literary Maps, Ushahidi, and Open Street Maps/Vespucci. 

Absorbing Sensor/ Contact data from the environment and using that data input to create experiences using Make-Makey or Arduino is part of the classroom experience. 

The Unit will culminate in a group project : A hand-made Literary Map of a popular fictional tale that one can walk into, depicting the events and emotions likely felt by the lead character and encoding these into cartographic terrain and other networked experiences using materials, shapes, and colour.
