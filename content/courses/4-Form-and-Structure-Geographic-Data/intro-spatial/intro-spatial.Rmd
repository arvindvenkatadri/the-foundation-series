## Introduction

Have you heard of a painter called Wassily Kandinksy? 

Here is a link to his [Top 40 Paintings. ](https://www.wassilykandinsky.net/painting1896-1944.php)
 
Let us listen to Mathew Ritchie tell us about Kandinsky. This will be a starting point for our journey into Form and Structure.

### Non-Fiction Time!

Kandinsky was remarkable for many things, but perhaps most so in that he wrote an entire book about why he painted, called the [Über das Geistige in der Kunst: Insbesondere in der Malerei (Concerning the Spiritual in Art: Especially in Painting)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46203/46203-h/46203-h.htm). This book, in German, is almost like a "credo". 

Since we can't read German, let us read parts of an Article about Kandinsky's credo: [Kandinsky, Math Artist? by Karl Kattchee, Proceedings of Bridges 2013: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture (2013), Pages 473–476 Short Papers](https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2013/bridges2013-473.pdf)
