## Abstract

> **It is a truth universally acknowledged, that ~~a single man~~ an Art and Design student, in possession of a good ~~fortune~~ Mac, must be ~~in want of a wife~~ terrified of coding.**
> <div style="text-align: right"> - <i>Code and Prejudice</i>, Jane Austen, 1870 </div>  


This Unit takes students on a journey of using data to tell stories, without writing one byte of code. The tools used are also web-based and require no installation. 

Datasets from various domains of *human enterprise and activity* are introduced. The datasets are motivated from the point of view of the *Types of Information* they contain: {{<hl>}}**Changes**, **Distributions**, **Ranking**, **Relations**, **Space**, and **Time**{{</hl>}}, for example. 

The {{<hl>}}**human contexts**{{</hl>}} from these datasets are used to appreciate the specifics of {{<hl>}}**data formats**{{</hl>}}, and the {{<hl>}}**nature of variables**{{</hl>}} within the data. Student will relate the data variables to Data/Information Visualizations, making decisions on how geometric shapes and other aspects of different Data Types and Visualizations can be metaphorically matched to the contexts. These {{<hl>}}**information-to-geometry metaphors**{{</hl>}} will lead us to {{<hl>}}**Insights**, **Questions**{{</hl>}}, and eventually to {{<hl>}}**Stories**{{</hl>}}.

Students will then be prompted to work in groups, or as a whole, to conduct a complete data gathering experiment on campus, visualise the data and tell a Story that pertains to their immediate surroundings. 

## What you will learn

- {{<hl>}}Data Basics{{</hl>}}: What does data look like and why should we care?
- {{<hl>}}How to Spot a good Variable{{</hl>}}
- What can we do with the data, visually? How do geometric attributes such as location, size, and colour, lend themselves to representing data?
- Creating {{<hl>}}Graphs and Data Visualizations{{</hl>}} using pure web-based point-and-click software {{<hl>}}Flourish Studio](https://flourish.studio){{</hl>}} and to create Story Board Infographics with them.
- Rapidly make different kinds of graphs
- Use Graphs and Tables as a way of getting answers to your {{<hl>}}Questions{{</hl>}}
- {{<hl>}}Develop intuition{{</hl>}} that matches data and graph types
- Learn to {{<hl>}}find data{{</hl>}} and appreciate how it was gathered in the first place
- Tell stories with data and graphs
- Annotate Graphs with text and insights
- Export these to create crisp and readable documents that you can share


## Introduction

Take a look at the graph visualization below:

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-teachers-who-are-female-in-primary-vs-tertiary-education" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"> </iframe>
<br>
What information does the graph convey? How ?   
What aspects of the Visual convey "human" information, such as Number and Relation?  
What could the sloping dotted line in the picture depict?

Over the next two weeks we will form our intuition about shapes and data and learn to create some evocative information graphics that tell stories.
