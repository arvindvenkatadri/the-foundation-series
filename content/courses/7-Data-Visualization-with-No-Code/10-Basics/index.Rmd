## Where does Data come from?

Let us look at the slides. Click on the icon above:

```{r}
knitr::include_url("10-Nature-of-Data/10-Nature-of-Data.html")

```

## Why Visualize?

-   We can digest information more easily when it is pictorial
-   Our [Working
    Memories](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/working-memory-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)
    are both *short-term* and *limited* in capacity. So a picture
    abstracts the details and presents us with an overall summary, an
    insight, or a story that is both easy to recall and easy on
    retention.\
-   Data Viz includes *shapes* that carry strong cultural memories and
    impressions for us. These cultural memories help us to use data viz
    in a *universal way* to appeal to a wide variety of audiences. (Do
    humans have a gene for geometry?)
-   It helps sift facts and mere statements: for example:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.alt= "Source https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-is-known-as-the-rape-capital-of-the-world-rahul-783495.html", fig.cap="Source https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-is-known-as-the-rape-capital-of-the-world-rahul-783495.html"}
knitr::include_graphics("rape-capital.png")

```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.alt= "Source https://datareveals.org/crime-data/", fig.cap= "Source https://datareveals.org/crime-data/"}
knitr::include_graphics("data-reveals-crime.png")

```

## How do we Spot Data Variable Types?

By asking questions!

As you go from `Qualitative` to `Quantitative` data types in the table,
I hope you can detect a movement from fuzzy groups/categories to more
and more crystallized numbers. Each variable/scale can be subjected to
the operations of the previous group. In the words of [S.S.
Stevens](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/what-is-the-difference-between-categorical-ordinal-and-interval-variables/)
,

> the basic operations needed to create each type of scale is
> cumulative: to an operation listed opposite a particular scale must be
> added all those operations preceding it.

## What Are the Parts of a Data Viz?

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

g <- diamonds %>% slice_sample(n = 500) %>% ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = cut)) + geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Plot Title", 
       subtitle = "Plot Subtitle",
       caption = "Plot Caption",
       x = "x-Axis Title",
       y = "y-Axis Title") + 
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title = "Plot Legend", 
                             colour = "orange")) + theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title.position = "panel",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, 
                                  colour = "orange"),
        legend.title = element_text(colour = "orange", 
                                    size = 12),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, 
                                     colour = "orange"),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, 
                                    colour = "orange"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "orange", 
                                    size = 12),
        axis.title.y = element_text(colour = "orange", 
                                    size = 12)
        )

annotation <- tibble(
   x = c(2,-0.01, 1.2),
   y = c(0, 10000, 17000),
   angle = c(0, 90, 0), 
   label = c("X-axis", "Y-axis", "Annotation")
)

# Add text
g + geom_text(data=annotation, aes( x=x, y=y, label=label, angle = angle),                 , 
           color="orange", 
           size=7 , fontface="bold" )
```

## How to pick a Data Viz?

Most Data Visualizations use one or more of the following geometric
attributes or aesthetics. These geometric aesthetics are used to
*represent* qualitative or quantitative variables from your data.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="From Claus Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization"}
knitr::include_graphics("common-aesthetics-1.png")
```

What does that mean? We can think of simple visualizations as
**combinations** of these aesthetics. Some examples:

+-----------+-----------+--------------------+-----------------------+
| Aesthetic | Aesthetic | Shape              | Chart Picture         |
| #1        | #2        |                    |                       |
