# Introduction

In TRIZ, the fundamental way of looking at an Inventive Design Problem is to discover and propose **Contradictions**. These are rendered in as **simple** and **stark** a language as possible...the starker the better! 

Once we have our Contradiction (and there can be more than one in a given Design Situation !) we can use TRIZ Principles to solve them **WITHOUT COMPROMISE**

# What are Contradictions?

We see them everywhere....if one is observant!! Let's see a few:

### C1: Contradiction-1
How is this for a Contradiction?  A shelf in a supermarket carries this placard for a shelf of ***FRESH JUICE***:

```{r include=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("twitter", "1453536795564683264")
```

### C2: Contradiction-2
Here is another:
```{r include=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1238079127992795137")
```
 
### C3: Contradiction-3
And another:
```{r include=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1276893105065771008")
```
Snails want to stay safe, and there is safety on the ground, but the ground is too hot.

### C4:Contradiction-4

Most people's healthcare is tied to their job....Therefore, every corona-time layoff creates yet another person without health insurance in this country. (*The Corona Pandemic needs healthcare and therefore health Insurance.* - AV)

This outbreak is highlighting, with extreme clarity, every major ***contradiction*** of this society and its decaying social order. <https://t.co/EtSUY3pPMi>

# Some Everyday Objects for us to Contemplate

What sort of Contradictions do we see in these familiar objects? What is good and what is not so good? Could that be the source of a problem to solve?
