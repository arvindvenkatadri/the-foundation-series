<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OpenStreetMap is a free map of the world, created by an ever growing community of mappers.</strong>
Anyone can edit OpenStreetMap. LearnOSM provides easy to understand, step-by-step guides for you to get started with contributing to OpenStreetMap and using OpenStreetMap and using OpenStreetMap data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will learn to edit the OSM and add to it features that are of our interest. These are usually reviewed by approved map-reviewers and if approved, become part of the OSM database.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Fire up <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a></p></li>
<li><p>Create a login ID and login</p></li>
<li><p>Hit the <code>edit</code> button at the upper left. Choose the <code>Edit with iD (in-browser editor)</code>. Go through the short walk through.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new feature on the Map using the buttons <code>Point</code>, ( or <code>Line</code> and <code>Area</code>&lt; if a specific building does not show up on the map. ) Give the <code>Point</code> a name and fill out the OSM fields that pop up at the left.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Activity: Treasure Hunt !!</h2>
<p>Now that you are able to make ( small ) editions to the OSM Map, it is time to create your Treasure Hunt!!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Let us form into two teams of 10 each. 7 people will be out walking and the remaining three will man the on-desktop mapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Form a Whatsapp group for your Team.</p></li>
<li><p>The Walkers will find specific interesting <code>Points</code> in the vicinity of campus, which are all of a <strong>similar category</strong> ( e.g eateries or hang out spots).</p></li>
<li><p>Send the details over Whatsapp so that the Mappers can map these on to OSM, populating the fields based on your street-side observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Come back to class.</p></li>
<li><p>As a Team, create cryptic/poetic/literary/pun-based clues for as many of your <code>Points</code> as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>See if the clues can create a sequence based on which one can traverse all the <code>Points</code> (nice to have, but not compulsory)</p></li>
<li><p>Each Team will share one clue at a time with the other team. Figure out how !!</p></li>
<li><p>The Team that first cracks all the <code>Points</code> and places a note on them on OSM will, ahem, get a prize. Yes, from me!!</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Flexing with a couple of Examples</h3>
<p>Try to crack these cryptic clues!</p>
<p>Some background for both: Think of a typical Apartment Complex, the standard “locations” and “features” within such a complex.</p>

<li>So JRR Tolkien has a quiet car for Gandalf? I can half hear it…</li>

<li>A sub-terranean address? Prime, prime location !!</li>
