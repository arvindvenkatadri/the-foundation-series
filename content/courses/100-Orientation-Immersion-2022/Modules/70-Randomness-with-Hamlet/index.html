<h3>Suppose we were Hamlet….</h3>
<p>What would we want to know?</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is our friend?</li>

</ul>
<p>Did Hamlet have an idea, any suspicion, that he might have wanted to
prove? Yes, he did, and that is why he <em>feigned madness</em>, so people
would open up and tell him things, in an unguarded way. So there was
<a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/hamlet/antichamlet.html"><em>craft in his
madness</em></a>.</p>
<p>If we wanted to know the truth of something, some guess, or a
<strong>Hypothesis</strong> that we had, then we would need to conduct an
“Experiment”, rather like Hamlet did, without quite going or <strong>feigning
madness</strong> of course. But there is a <strong>Madness to the Method</strong>, as we
will see…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem
definition/Hypothesis through to conclusions — this is typically not
the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a
series of feedback loops. A summary of a revised PPDAC approach is
shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise
sequence (1→5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often
will feed back to the previous stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the
reverse direction, starting with Problem definition and then examining
expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions
(without pre-judging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues,
step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e→a) determining the
implications of these expectations for each stage of the process.</p>

<div id="design-of-experiments" class="section level3">
<h3>Design of Experiments</h3>
<p>Let us pretend we are Hamlet and design a simple experiment to find out
some “truth” (highly probable idea) that is important to us.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Let us consider the <strong>Short Term Memory(STM)</strong> of Foundation Students;
Or , we could use the <strong>Guilford Divergent Thinking Test for Alternative
Uses</strong> as our vehicle for testing similar Hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>STM scores are significantly different between students of Design
and those of Art (;-O)</li>
<li>Any other factors, not related to types of individuals, but more
like parameters of STM itself, such as:
<ul>
<li>Word complexity (Syllables per Word)</li>
<li>No of Words</li>
<li>Exposure Time and Recall Time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Students who speak their Mother Tongue fluently score better in
Divergent Thinking Scores (Fluency, Flexibility, Elaboration,
Originality)</li>
<li>There is a significant difference in Guilford Scores between
students from “small towns” and those from metros.</li>
</ul>
<div id="factors" class="section level4">
<h4>Factors</h4>
<p>In each of these Hypotheses, we can see that there are <em>binary</em>
(two-valued) parameters that are part of the test: <code>Art vs Design</code>,
<code>Speaks Mother Tongue or Not</code>, <code>Small Town vs Metro</code>,
<code>Long vs Short List of Words</code>, <code>Short vs Long Words</code> and
<code>Long vs Short Exposure</code>.</p>
<p>If we want our experiment to be <strong>fair</strong> we must have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Devise a test tool for each combination of binary parameters (<em>Test
Type</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>the <strong>same number</strong> of subjects for each Test Type</p></li>
<li><p><strong>randomly</strong> select the people as <em>respondents</em> each Test Type</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will choose one of these questions, or a similar one, and use the
<strong>PPDAC Method</strong> to proceed with our Experiment. This paper by Lawrence
to guide our Hypothesis Testing and the Design of our Experiment:
<strong>Lawrence - A Design of Experiments Workshop as an Introduction to
Statistics</strong> <a href="Lawrence%20-%20A%20Design%20of%20Experiments%20Workshop%20as%20an%20Introduction%20to%20Statistics.pdf">(<strong>Weblink to
PDF</strong>)</a>.
This is the paper describing a simple <em>Design of Experiments</em> workshop
in class much like ours. We will try to mimic as much of this as we can.
Do read through this in the evening today in preparation for our
experiment.</p>

<h3>Data Analysis-1: Comparison of STM Histograms using Excel and WTFcsv</h3>
<p>Once our test is complete, let us collate all the data for all tests
using Excel. (This is for the STM Hypothesis; we can adapt this
spreadsheet for any other hypothesis test with categorical factors and
scores.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download this <a href="STM.xlsx"><strong>spreadsheet</strong></a> and save as your own
<em>named</em> local copy.</li>
<li>Enter the data from all tests on the first sheet titled “RawData”
(the one with the warning)</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate this data</strong> on the sheet titled “Data Duplicated”. <strong>Do
not touch</strong> the “RawData” sheet again.</li>
<li>For each of the <em>factors</em> under consideration, we will need to stack
up STM scores from <span class="math inline">\(2^3 = 8\)</span> tests, i.e. eight columns.</li>
<li>If we have three two-valued, categorical factors, we will get three
sets of stacked scores, each from a (shuffled) set of the tests.</li>
<li>Half the scores in these stacked columns will pertain to one <em>level</em>
of the factor, and the other half of the scores will pertain to the
other level. (This should remind you of the Karnaugh Map you may
have learnt in your digital logic courses in school.). See example
below: it shows how we can stack up the scores from <em>4</em> tests for
each <em>level</em> of the parameter <em>p1</em>.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>##   scores test    p1    p2    p3
## 1     20    A  True  Long   Big
## 2     20    B  True  Long Small
## 3     20    C  True Short   Big
## 4     20    D  True Short Small
## 5     20    E False  Long   Big
## 6     20    F False  Long Small

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We will set up each of these <em>two stacked-score columns</em> in Col A on
separate sheets, similar to the one shown in the sheet titled
“Permutation Test”. One sheet for each two-valued parameter.</li>
<li>Create <em>paired</em> Histograms for each of the two stacked-score columns
using WTFcsv, or Excel itself if you are confident. Ensure that
there are <em>TWO</em> Histograms: one for each value of the factor under
consideration.</li>
<li>Inspection of the shapes and locations of these paired Histograms
may give you an idea whether the factor under consideration has any
effect on STM scores or none.</li>

<p>From: Tim C. Hesterberg (2015) <em>What Teachers Should Know About the
Bootstrap: Resampling in the Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum</em>, The

<blockquote>
<p>Student B. R. was annoyed by TV commercials. He suspected that there
were more commercials in the “basic” TV channels, the ones that come
with a cable TV subscription, than in the “extended” channels you pay
extra for. To check this, he collected the data shown in Table 1. He
measured an average of 9.21 minutes of commercials per half hour in
the basic channels, vs only 6.87 minutes in the extended channels.
This seems to support his hypothesis. But there is not much
data—perhaps the difference was just random. The poor guy could only
stand to watch 20 random half hours of TV. Actually, he didn’t even do
that—he got his girlfriend to watch half of it. (Are you as appalled
by the deluge of commercials as I am? This is per half-hour!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average difference in ad times between the two sets of TV channels
is 2.34.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How easy would it be for a difference of 2.34 minutes to occur just by
chance? To answer this, we suppose there really is no difference
between the two groups, that “basic” and “extended” are just labels.
So what would happen if we assign labels randomly? How often would a
difference like 2.34 occur?</p>
<p>We’ll pool all twenty observations, <strong>randomly</strong> pick 10 of them to
label “basic” and label the rest “extended”, and compute the
difference in means between the two groups. We’ll repeat that many
times, say ten thousand, to get the <em>permutation distribution</em> shown
in Figure 1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The observed statistic 2.34 is also shown; the fraction of the
distribution to the right of that value (≥ 2.34) is the probability
that random labeling would give a difference that large. In this case,
the probability of this value ( area coloured in green ) is &lt; 0.005.</p>
<p>It would be rare for a difference this large to occur by chance. We
have randomly tried “all possible chances” and are <em>hardly able to
achieve similar,</em> and the rarer something is, the more likely that
there is an underlying truth.</p>
<p>And therefore we conclude there is a real difference between the
groups and that ad time is different between <code>basic</code> and <code>extended</code> TV
channels.</p>

<h3>Data Analysis-2: Creating Parallel Worlds</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We will execute on Permutation Test on one sheet step by step and
decide whether that factor had a significant <em>effect</em> on STM scores.</li>
<li>We <strong>pretend</strong> that there is no difference in scores whether the
factor is chosen on way or another.</li>
<li>We <strong>mechanize this pretence</strong> by lumping “both kinds” of scores
together and shuffle them and divide them, <strong>randomly</strong> into two
groups, and take the difference in scores.</li>
<li>We can do this, like we did with our Monte Carlo experiment, many
many times and calculate difference in scores each time. (It is like
inventing many parallel worlds)</li>
<li>If we look at the way these <strong>randomly computed</strong> scores are
distributed and <strong>compare</strong> with the one measurement we did see, we
can decide whether Mother Nature is up to something, or we are able
to mimic the Mom.</li>
<li>If we are <strong>not</strong> able to mimic Mom, then <strong>Mom always knows</strong> and
we bow to her and ascribe a significance to the factor under
