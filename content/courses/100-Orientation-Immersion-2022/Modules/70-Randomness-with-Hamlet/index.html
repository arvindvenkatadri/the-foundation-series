<li>Let us first examine the street traffic data we have gathered for any “model-like” pattern!</li>

<p>We will use a tool called, umm….<strong>WTFcsv</strong>. Let us first quickly see what this tool offers us!</p>

<h3>Hamlet is also like us !!</h3>
<p>Let us read the famous nunnery scene from <strong>Hamlet</strong>:</p>

<p>What was Hamlet’s problem? How did he solve that problem?</p>
</div>
<div id="suppose-we-were-hamlet." class="section level3">
<h3>Suppose we were Hamlet….</h3>
<p>What would we want to know?<br />
- Who is our friend?<br />
- What is the chance that we will survive?<br />
- Who killed Dad?</p>
<p>Did Hamlet have an idea, any suspicion, that he might have wanted to prove? Yes, he did, and that is why he <em>feigned madness</em>, so people would open up and tell him things, in an unguarded way. So there was <a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/hamlet/antichamlet.html"><em>craft in his madness</em></a>.</p>
<p>If we wanted to know the truth of something, some guess, or a <strong>Hypothesis</strong> that we had, then we would need to conduct an “Experiment”, rather like Hamlet did, without quite going or <strong>feigning madness</strong> of course. But there is a <strong>Madness to the Method</strong>, as we will see…</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.statsref.com/HTML/?statistics__statistical_analys.html">StatsRef</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem definition/Hypothesis through to conclusions — this is typically not the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a series of feedback loops. A summary of a revised PPDAC approach is shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise sequence (1→5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often will feed back to the previous stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the reverse direction, starting with Problem definition and then examining expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions (without pre-judging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues, step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e→a) determining the implications of these expectations for each stage of the process.</p>

<div id="design-of-experiments" class="section level3">
<h3>Design of Experiments</h3>
<p>Let us pretend we are Hamlet and design a simple experiment to find out some “truth” ( highly probable idea) that is important to us.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Let us consider the <strong>Short Term Memory</strong> of Foundation Students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it different between those who pursue “<em>Art-related</em>” degrees and those who pursue “<em>Design-related</em>” degrees?<br />
</li>
<li>Between Male and Female students?<br />
</li>
<li>Any other factors, not related to types of individuals, but more like parameters of STM itself?</li>
</ul>
<p>Or we could use the <a href="https://curtbonk.com/bobweb/r546/modules/creativity/creativity_tests/guilford_uses_task.html"><strong>Guilford Test for Alternative Uses</strong></a> as our vehicle for testing similar Hypotheses.</p>
<p>We will choose one of these questions, or a similar one, and use the <strong>PPDAC Method</strong> to proceed with our Experiment. This paper by Lawrence to guide our Hypothesis Testing and the Design of our Experiment:</p>

</ul>
<p>This is the paper describing a simple <em>Design of Experiments</em> workshop in class much like ours. We will try to mimic as much of this as we can. Do read through this in the evening today in preparation for our experiment.</p>

<h3>Data Analysis-1: Comparison of STM Histograms using Excel and WTFcsv</h3>
<p>Once our test is complete, let us collate all the data for all tests using Excel. (This is for the STM Hypothesis; we can adapt this spreadsheet for any other hypothesis test with categorical factors and scores.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download this <a href="STM.xlsx"><strong>spreadsheet</strong></a> and save as your own <em>named</em> local copy.</li>
<li>Enter the data from all tests on the first sheet titled “RawData” (the one with the warning)</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate this data</strong> on the sheet titled “Data Duplicated”. <strong>Do not touch</strong> the “RawData” sheet again.</li>
<li>For each of the <em>factors</em> under consideration, we will need to stack up STM scores from <span class="math inline">\(2^3 = 8\)</span> tests, i.e. eight columns.</li>
<li>If we have three two-valued, categorical factors, we will get three sets of stacked scores, each from a (shuffled) set of the tests.</li>
<li>Half the scores in these stacked columns will pertain to one <em>level</em> of the factor, and the other half of the scores will pertain to the other level. (This should remind you of the Karnaugh Map you may have learnt in your digital logic courses in school.). See example below: it shows how we can stack up the scores from <em>4</em> tests for each <em>level</em> of the parameter <em>p1</em>.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>##   scores test    p1    p2    p3
## 1     20    A  True  Long   Big
## 2     20    B  True  Long Small
## 3     20    C  True Short   Big
## 4     20    D  True Short Small
## 5     20    E False  Long   Big
## 6     20    F False  Long Small
## 7     20    G False Short   Big
## 8     20    H False Short Small</code></pre>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We will set up each of these <em>two stacked-score columns</em> in Col A on separate sheets, similar to the one shown in the sheet titled “Permutation Test”. One sheet for each two-valued parameter.</li>
<li>Create <em>paired</em> Histograms for each of the two stacked-score columns using WTFcsv, or Excel itself if you are confident. Ensure that there are <em>TWO</em> Histograms: one for each value of the factor under consideration.</li>
<li>Inspection of the shapes and locations of these paired Histograms may give you an idea whether the factor under consideration has any effect on STM scores or none.</li>

<h3>The Permutation Test</h3>
<p>From: Tim C. Hesterberg (2015) <em>What Teachers Should Know About the Bootstrap: Resampling in the Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum</em>, The American Statistician, 69:4, 371-386, DOI: 10.1080/00031305.2015.1089789</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Student B. R. was annoyed by TV commercials. He suspected that there
were more commercials in the “basic” TV channels, the ones that come with a cable TV subscription, than in the “extended” channels you pay extra for. To check this, he collected the data shown in Table 1. He measured an average of 9.21 minutes of commercials per half hour
in the basic channels, vs only 6.87 minutes in the extended channels. This seems to support his hypothesis. But there is not much data—perhaps the difference was just random. The poor guy could only stand to watch 20 random half hours of TV. Actually, he didn’t even do that—he got his girlfriend to watch half of it. (Are you as appalled by the deluge of commercials as I am? This is per half-hour!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average difference in ad times between the two sets of TV channels is 2.34.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How easy would it be for a difference of 2.34 minutes to occur just by chance? To answer this, we suppose there really is no difference between the two groups, that “basic” and “extended” are just labels. So what would happen if we assign labels randomly? How often would a difference like 2.34 occur? We’ll pool all twenty observations, randomly pick 10 of them to label “basic” and label the rest “extended”, and compute the difference in means between the two groups. We’ll repeat that many times, say ten thousand, to get the permutation distribution shown in Figure 1. The observed statistic 2.34 is also shown; the fraction of the distribution to the right of that value (≥ 2.34) is the probability that random labeling would give a difference that large. In this case, the probability, the P-value, is 0.005; it would be rare for a difference this large to occur by chance. Hence we conclude there is a real difference between the groups.</p>
