## Introduction

We will play several short games followed by discussions. These games may bring to light some of our Cognitive Biases and see how they affect us, and especially as we try to function as Artists/Designers/Creators. 

There will be short readings that follow after each game.

But first, let us see how frail/fragile/fallible... we **all** are:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "9Il_D3Xt9W0")
```

<br>
<br>


Right! On to our first little fallibility!


### Cognitive Miserliness


```{r, echo=FALSE}

### Exaggerated Emotional Coherence

<br>

Tool: [**PDF**](Halo-Effect-Test_tool.pdf)

Reading: Here is a short reading on Exaggerated Emotional Coherence, also known as the *Halo Effect*[** Download PDF **](Exaggerated-Emotional-Coherence.pdf)

### A Bayesian Game


TBD!! ;-(



### Activity

Let's find some of these ideas in our favourite Episode of one Season of your favourite show and tell everybody with a poster!
