<h2>UNIT ABSTRACT: (The background and the core idea of the unit)</h2>
<p>This Unit is a set of Orientation and Immersion Activities in the Foundation (freshman) year of a Bachelor’s Degree in Art and Design, at the Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, Bangalore, India. The intent of this Unit is to help students to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Networking, Identity, and Aspiration</strong>. By creating something in teams, students meet new people and start to create new networks. Identity is about their personal values, their upbringing, and family culture, and how it can be displayed and be a part of their creative practice. Aspiration is about creative possibility, a noticing or discovery of some extraordinary skill or ability in this classroom, and to desire and want to develop that skill during a Srishti-long, (maybe life-long) journey.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tools and Experiences, Big Understandings, and Creative Purposes</strong>. Students will be guided to observe their surroundings by listening, seeing, smelling, touching, and tasting, mapping, and drawing. There will also be gamified situations in the classroom itself. Several Big Ideas that are relevant and applicable across subjects will be introduced. Students will use the activities, observations, and analytical skills to evolve an art and design expression that will enable them to creatively evolve ways of exploration and understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Art Experience</strong>. Several artists and their oeuvre will be studied and appreciated. The creative motivations and ideas that <em>may</em> underlie these pieces of work will be discussed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughlines (i.e. generalizable ideas) will be drawn across individual Experiences and Concepts from each of these, and the students will be encouraged to express the understanding of these in an artifact.</p>
