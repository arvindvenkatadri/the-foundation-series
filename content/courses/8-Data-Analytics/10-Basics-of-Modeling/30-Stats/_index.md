## Introduction

In this set of modules we will explore Sampling, Summary Statistics, Statistical Tests for data. 


# Pedagogical Note

Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach
stats)[\^1], written by Jonas Lindeløv. The book beautifully
demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test,
ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model. The book
also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when
certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear
models using the rank of values.

This approach offers a way to greatly simplify the teaching of
introductory statistics, using the simple model of the form
$y = a + b⋅x$ which is familiar to most students. This approach brings
coherence to a wide-range of statistical tests, which are usually taught
to students as independent tools with a potentially-overwhelming array
of names. The approach also helps to explain the intuition underlying
statistical tests, drawing on the familiar concept of linear
regressions, which emphasizes understanding over rote learning.
