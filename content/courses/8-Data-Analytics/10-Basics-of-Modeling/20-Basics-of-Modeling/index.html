<h2>What is a Model?</h2>
<p>Not only does equation 1.4 describe the major elements of mathematical or spreadsheet models,
but it also provides a convenient means for comparing and contrasting the three major categories of modeling (or analytics) techniques presented in this book—descriptive models, predictive
models, and prescriptive models. Figure 1.3 summarizes the characteristics and some of the techniques associated with each of these categories.
