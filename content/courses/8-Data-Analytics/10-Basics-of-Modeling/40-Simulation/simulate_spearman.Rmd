This document presents the close relationship between Spearman correlation and Pearson correlation. Namely, that Spearman correlation is just a Pearson correlation on $rank$ed $x$ and $y$. It is an appendix to the post "[Common statistical tests as linear models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear)".

**TL;DR: Below, I argue that this approximation is good enough when the sample size is 12 or greater and virtually perfect when the sample size is 20 or greater.**

# Simple example
Here, I start by creating some mildly correlated data. Note that the distribution of the data does not matter since everything is ranked, so the results are identical for non-normal data.

```{r}
data = MASS::mvrnorm(50, mu=c(2, 2), Sigma=cbind(c(1, 0.4), c(0.4, 1)))
x = data[,1]
y = data[,2]
plot(rank(y) ~ rank(x))
```

Now let's test it
<div class='fold s'>
```{r example, results='hold'}
# Three ways of running the same model
spearman = cor.test(x, y, method='spearman')
pearson = cor.test(rank(x), rank(y), method='pearson')  # On ranks
linear = summary(lm(rank(y) ~ rank(x)))  # Linear is identical to pearson; just showing.

# Present the results
print('coefficient rho is exactly identical:')
rbind(spearman=spearman$estimate, 
      ranked_pearson=pearson$estimate, 
      ranked_linear=linear$coefficients[2])

print('p is approximately identical:')
rbind(spearman=spearman$p.value, 
      ranked_pearson=pearson$p.value, 
      ranked_linear=linear$coefficients[8])
```
</div>

The correlation coefficients are exact. And the p-values are quite close! But maybe we were just lucky? Let's put it to the test:


# Simulate for different N and r

The code below does the following:

1. Generate some correlated data for all combinations of the correlation coefficient ($r = 0, 0.5, 0.95$) and sample sizes 1 $N = 6, 8, 10, ... 20, 30, 50, 80$. 
2. Compute coefficients and p-values for Spearman correlation test and Pearson correlation on the ranked values, many times for each combination.
3. Calculate the number of errors.

```{r simulate, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Settings for data simulation
PERMUTATIONS = 1:200
Ns = c(seq(from=6, to=20, by=2), 30, 50, 80)  # Sample sizes to model
rs = c(0, 0.5, 0.95)  # Correlation coefficients to model

# Begin
D = expand.grid(set=PERMUTATIONS, r=rs, N=Ns) %>%  # Combinations of N and r
  mutate(
    # Use the parameters to generate correlated data in each row
    data = map2(N, r, function(N, r) MASS::mvrnorm(N, mu=c(0, 4), Sigma=cbind(c(1, r), c(r, 1)))),
    
    # Tests
    pearson_raw = map(data, ~cor.test(rank(.x[, 1]), rank(.x[, 2]), method='pearson')),
    spearman_raw = map(data, ~cor.test(.x[, 1], .x[, 2], method = 'spearman')),
    
    # Tidy it up
    pearson = map(pearson_raw, broom::tidy),
    spearman = map(spearman_raw, broom::tidy),
  ) %>%
  
  # Get estimates "out" of the tidied results.
  unnest(pearson, spearman, .sep='_') %>%
  select(-data, -pearson_raw, -spearman_raw)
  
  # If you want to do a permutation-based Spearman to better handle ties and
  # overcome issues on how to compute p (computationally heavy).
  # Corresponds very closely to R's spearman p-values
  #mutate(p.perm = map(data, ~ coin::pvalue(coin::spearman_test(.x[,1] ~ .x[,2], distribution='approximate')))) %>%
  #unnest(p.perm)

head(D)
```


### Inspect correlation coefficients
Just as we saw in the simple example above, correlation coefficients (`estimate` and `estimate1`) are identical per definition. We can see that by calculating the difference and see that it is always zero:
```{r}
summary(D$estimate - D$estimate1)
```

Yup. The minimum difference is zero. The maximum is zero. All of them are identicalNo need to look further into that.


### Inspet p-values
Before getting started on p-values, note that there are several ways of calculating them for Spearman correlations. This is the relevant section from the documentation of `cor.test`:

> For Spearman's test, p-values are computed using algorithm AS 89 for n < 1290 and exact = TRUE, otherwise via the asymptotic t approximation. Note that these are ‘exact’ for n < 10, and use an Edgeworth series approximation for larger sample sizes (the cutoff has been changed from the original paper).

You can get beyond all of that by doing permutation-based tests at the cost of computational power (see outcommented code above). However, there is almost virtually perfect correspondence, so I just rely on R's more computationally efficient p-values.

Below, I plot the difference between Spearman-derived p-values and ranked-Pearson-derived p-values. I have chosen not to plot as a function or `r` in the name of simplicity because it makes no difference whatsoever, but feel free to try it out yourself.

<div class='fold s'>
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=10}
library(patchwork)

# A straight-up comparison of the p-values
p_relative = ggplot(D, aes(x=spearman_p.value, y=pearson_p.value, color=N)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=0.05, lty=2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0.05, lty=2) +
  
  labs(title='Absolute relation', x = 'Spearman p-value', y = 'Pearson p-value') + 
  #coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0, 0.10), ylim=c(0, 0.11)) + 
  theme_gray(13) + 
  guides(color=FALSE)

# Looking at the difference (error) between p-values
p_error_all = ggplot(D, aes(x=spearman_p.value, y=pearson_p.value-spearman_p.value, color=factor(N))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=0.05, lty=2) +
  
  labs(title='Error', x='Spearman p-value', y='Difference') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(-0.02, 0.005)) + 
  theme_gray(13) + 
  guides(color=FALSE)

# Same, but zoomed in around p=0.05
p_error_zoom = ggplot(D, aes(x=spearman_p.value, y=pearson_p.value-spearman_p.value, color=factor(N))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=0.05, lty=2) +
  
  labs(title='Error zoomed', x='Spearman p-value', y='Difference') + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(-0.02, 0.005), xlim=c(0, 0.10)) + 
  theme_gray(13)

# Show it. Patchwork is your friend!
p_relative + p_error_all + p_error_zoom
```
</div>
*Figure: The jagget lines in the leftmost two panels are due to R computing "exact" p-values for Spearman when N < 10. For samples larger than N>=10, an approximation is used which gives a smoother relationship.*


It is clear that larger N gives a closer correspondence. For small p, the Pearson-derived p-values are lower than Spearman, i.e. more liberal. Importantly, when N=12, this effect is at most 0.5% in the "significance-region" which I deem acceptable enough for the present purposes. When N=20, the error is at most 0.2% for the whole curve and there is no difference when N=50 or N=100.

# Conclusion
The correlation coefficients are identical.

The p-value is exact enough when N > 10 and virtualy perfect when N > 20. If you are doing correlation studies on sample sizes lower than this, you have larger inferential problems than those posed by the slight differences between Spearman and Pearson.
