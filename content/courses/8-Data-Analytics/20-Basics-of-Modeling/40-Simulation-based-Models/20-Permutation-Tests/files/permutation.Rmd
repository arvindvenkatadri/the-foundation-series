## Permutation Tests

### Case Study-1: Hot Wings Orders vs Gender

A student conducted a study of hot wings and beer consumption at a Bar.
She asked patrons at the bar to record their consumption of hot wings
and beer over the course of several hours. She wanted to know if people
who ate more hot wings would then drink more beer. In addition, she
investigated whether or not gender had an impact on hot wings or beer
consumption.

```{r}

Beerwings <- read.csv("https://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/data2/Beerwings.csv")
inspect(Beerwings)

```

Let us calculate the observed difference in `Hotwings` consumption
between Males and Females ( `Gender`)

```{r}

mean(Hotwings ~ Gender, data = Beerwings)
obs_diff_wings <- mosaic::diffmean(data = Beerwings, Hotwings ~ Gender)
obs_diff_wings 

```

```{r}

gf_boxplot(data = Beerwings, Hotwings ~ Gender, title = "Hotwings Consumption by Gender")

```

The observed difference in mean consumption of Hotwings between Males
and Females is 5.2. Could this have occurred by chance? Here is our
formulation of the Hypotheses:

$$
NULL\ Hypothesis\ H_0 => No\Â difference\ between\ means\ across\ groups\\
Alternative\ Hypothesis\
H_a =>Significant\ difference\ between\ the\ means\
$$

So we perform a Permutation Test to check:

```{r}

null_dist_wings <- do(1000) * diffmean(Hotwings ~ shuffle(Gender), data = Beerwings)
null_dist_wings %>% head()

gf_histogram(data = null_dist_wings, ~ diffmean) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_wings, colour = "red")

prop1(~ diffmean >= obs_diff_wings, data = null_dist_wings)

```

The $\color{red}{red\ line}$ shows the actual measured mean difference
in Hot Wings consumption. The probability that our Permutation
distribution is able to equal or exceed that number is $0.001998002$ and
we have to reject the Null Hypothesis that the means are identical.

### Case Study-2: Verizon

```{r}

verizon <- read.csv("https://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/data2/Verizon.csv")
inspect(verizon)

```

```{r}

mean(Time ~ Group, data = verizon)
obs_diff_verizon <- diffmean(Time ~ Group, data = verizon)
obs_diff_verizon

```

```{r}

null_dist_verizon <- do(1000) * diffmean(Time ~ shuffle(Group), data = verizon)
gf_histogram(data = null_dist_verizon, ~ diffmean) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_wings, colour = "red")

prop1(~ diffmean >= obs_diff_wings, data = null_dist_verizon)

```

### Case Story-3: Recidivism

Do criminals released after a jail term commit crimes again?

```{r}

recidivism <- read.csv("http://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/data2/Recidivism.csv")
inspect(recidivism)

```

There are some missing values in the variable <tt> `Age25`</tt>. The
<tt> `complete.cases`</tt> command gives the row numbers where values
are not missing. We create a new data frame omitting the rows where
there is a missing value in the <tt> 'Age25' </tt> variable.

```{r}

recidivism_na <- recidivism %>% tidyr::drop_na(Age25)

```

Also, the variable <tt>`Recid`</tt> is a factor variable coded "Yes" or
"No". We convert it to a numeric variable of 1's and 0's.

```{r}

recidivism_na <- recidivism_na %>% mutate(Recid2 = ifelse(Recid=="Yes", 1, 0))

obs_diff_recid <- diffmean( Recid2 ~ Age25, data = recidivism_na)
obs_diff_recid

null_dist_recid <- do(1000) * diffmean( Recid2 ~ shuffle(Age25), data = recidivism_na)

gf_histogram( ~ diffmean, data = null_dist_recid) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_recid, colour = "red")

```

### Case Study-4: Matched Pairs: Results from a diving championship.

```{r}

Diving2017 <- read.csv("http://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/data2/Diving2017.csv")
head(Diving2017)
inspect(Diving2017)

```

The data is made up of **paired** observations per swimmer. So we need
to take the difference between the two swim records for *each* swimmer
and then shuffle the differences to either polarity. Another way to look
at this is to shuffle the records between `Semifinal` and `Final` on a
per Swimmer basis.

```{r}

Diving2017
Diving2017 %>% diffmean(data = ., Final ~ Semifinal, only.2 = FALSE)

obs_diff_swim <- mean(~ Final - Semifinal, data = Diving2017)
obs_diff_swim

```

```{r}

polarity <- c(rep(1, 6), rep(-1,6))
polarity
null_dist_swim <- do(100000) * mean(data = Diving2017, 
                                    ~(Final - Semifinal) * resample(polarity,
                                                    replace = TRUE))
null_dist_swim %>% head()
gf_histogram(data = null_dist_swim, ~mean) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_swim, colour = "red")

```

### Case Study #5: Flight Delays

LaGuardia Airport (LGA) is one of three major airports that serves the
New York City metropolitan area. In 2008, over 23 million passengers and
over 375 000 planes flew in or out of LGA. United Airlines and America
Airlines are two major airlines that schedule services at LGA. The data
set `FlightDelays` contains information on all 4029 departures of these
two airlines from LGA during May and June 2009.

```{r}

flightDelays <- read.csv("http://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/data2/FlightDelays.csv")

inspect(flightDelays)

```

The variables in the `flightDelays` dataset are:

| Variable     | Description                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Carrier      | UA=United Airlines, AA=American Airlines                    |
| FlightNo     | Flight number                                               |
| Destination  | Airport code                                                |
| DepartTime   | Scheduled departure time in 4 h intervals                   |
| Day          | Day of the Week                                             |
| Month        | May or June                                                 |
| Delay        | Minutes flight delayed (negative indicates early departure) |
| Delayed30    | Departure delayed more than 30 min? Yes or No               |
| FlightLength | Length of time of flight (minutes)                          |

: flightDelay dataset variables

a)  Let us compute the proportion of times that each carrier's flights
    was delayed more than 20 min. We will conduct a two-sided test to
    see if the difference in these proportions is statistically
    significant.

```{r flightDelays-a}

prop(data = flightDelays, Delay >= 20 ~ Carrier)
obs_diff_delay <- diffprop(data = flightDelays, Delay >= 20 ~ Carrier)
obs_diff_delay

```

We see carrier AA has a 17.13% chance of delays\>= 20, while UA has
22.26% chance. The difference is 5.12%. Is this statistically
significant? We take the Delays for both Carriers and perform a
permutation test by `shuffle` on the `carrier` variable:

```{r}

null_dist_delay <- do(10000) * diffprop(data = flightDelays, Delay >= 20 ~ shuffle(Carrier))
null_dist_delay %>% head()
gf_histogram(data = null_dist_delay, ~ diffprop) %>% gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_delay, color = "red")

```

It appears that the difference indelay times is significant. We can
compute the `p-value` based on this test:

```{r}

2* mean(null_dist_delay >= obs_diff_delay)

```

which is very small. Hence we reject the null Hypothesis that there is
no difference between `carrier`s on `delay times`.

b)  Compute the variance in the flight delay lengths for each carrier.
    Conduct a test to see if the variance for United Airlines differs
    from that of American Airlines.

```{r}

var(data = flightDelays, Delay ~ Carrier)

# There is no readymade function in mosaic called `diffvar`...so...we construct one
obs_diff_var <- diff(var(data = flightDelays, Delay ~ Carrier))
obs_diff_var

```

The difference in variances in `Delay` between the two `carrier`s is
$-431.0677$. In our Permutation Test, we `shuffle` the `Carrier`
variable:

```{r}

obs_diff_var <- diff(var(data = flightDelays, Delay ~ Carrier))
null_dist_var <-
  do(10000) * diff(var(data = flightDelays, Delay ~ shuffle(Carrier)))
null_dist_var %>% head()

# The null distribution variable is called `UA`
gf_histogram(data = null_dist_var, ~ UA) %>% gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_delay, color = "red")
2 * mean(null_dist_var >= obs_diff_var)

```

Clearly there is no case for a significant difference in variances!

### Case Study #6: Walmart vs Target

Is there a difference in the price of groceries sold by the two
retailers Target and Walmart? The data set `Groceries` contains a sample
of grocery items and their prices advertised on their respective web
sites on one specific day.

a)  Inspect the data set, then explain why this is an example of matched
    pairs data.
b)  Compute summary statistics of the prices for each store.
c)  Conduct a permutation test to determine whether or not there is a
    difference in the mean prices.
d)  Create a ~~histogram~~ bar-chart of the difference in prices. What
    is unusual about Quaker Oats Life cereal?
e)  Redo the hypothesis test without this observation. Do you reach the
    same conclusion?

```{r}

groceries <- read.csv("http://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/data2/Groceries.csv") %>% mutate(Product = stringr::str_squish(Product))
head(groceries)
inspect(groceries)

```

We see that the comparison is to be made between two prices for the
*same* product, and hence this is one more example of `paired data`, as
in Case Study #4. Let us plot the prices for the products:

```{r}

gf_col(data = groceries,
       Target ~ Product,
       fill = "#0073C299",
       width = 0.5 ) %>% 
  gf_col(data = groceries,
         -Walmart ~ Product,
         fill = "#EFC00099",
         ylab = "Prices",
         width = 0.5
       ) %>% 
  gf_col(data = groceries %>% filter(Product == "Quaker Oats Life Cereal Original"), 
         -Walmart ~ Product,
         fill = "red", 
         width = 0.5) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_classic()) %>%
  gf_theme(ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    size = 8,
    face = "bold",
    vjust = 0,
    hjust = 1
  ))) %>% gf_theme(ggplot2::coord_flip())

```

We see that the price difference between Walmart and Target prices is
highest for the `Product` named `Quaker Oats Life Cereal Original`. Let
us check the mean difference in prices:

```{r}

diffmean(data = groceries, Walmart ~ Target, only.2 = FALSE)
obs_diff_price = mean( ~ Walmart - Target, data = groceries)
obs_diff_price

```

Let us perform the pair-wise permutation test on prices, by shuffling
the two store names:

```{r}

polarity <- c(rep(1, 15), rep(-1,15))
polarity
null_dist_price <- do(100000) * mean(data = groceries, 
                                    ~(Walmart-Target) * resample(polarity,
                                                    replace = TRUE))
null_dist_price %>% head()
gf_histogram(data = null_dist_price, ~mean) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_price, colour = "red")

2*(sum(null_dist_price >= obs_diff_price + 1)/(100000+1)) #P-value

```

Does not seem to be aby significant difference in prices...

Suppose we knock off the Quaker Cereal data item...

```{r}

which(groceries$Product == "Quaker Oats Life Cereal Original")
groceries_less <- groceries[-2,]
groceries_less


obs_diff_price_less = mean( ~ Walmart - Target, data = groceries_less)
obs_diff_price_less
polarity_less <- c(rep(1, 15), rep(-1,14)) # Due to resampling this small bias makes no difference
null_dist_price_less <- do(100000) * mean(data = groceries_less, 
                                    ~(Walmart-Target) * resample(polarity_less,
                                                    replace = TRUE))
null_dist_price_less %>% head()
gf_histogram(data = null_dist_price_less, ~mean) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_price_less, colour = "red")

1- mean(null_dist_price_less >= obs_diff_price_less) #P-value

```

### Case Study 7: Proportions between Categorical Variables

Let us try a dataset with Qualitative / Categorical data. This is a
General Social Survey dataset, and we have people with different levels
of `Education` stating their opinion on the `Death Penalty`. We want to
know if these two Categorical variables have a correlation, i.e. can the
opinions in favour of the Death Penalty be explained by the Education
level?

Since data is Categorical, we need to take `counts` in a table, and then
implement a `chi-square test`. In the test, we will permute the
`Education` variable to see if we can see how significant its *effect
size* is.

```{r}

GSS2002 <- read.csv("http://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/data2/GSS2002.csv")
inspect(GSS2002)

```

Note how *all* variables are Categorical !! `Education` has five
`levels`:

```{r}

GSS2002 %>% count(Education)
GSS2002 %>% count(DeathPenalty)

```

Let us drop NA entries in Education and Death Penalty. And set up a table for the chi-square test.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

gss2002 <- GSS2002 %>% 
  dplyr::select(Education, DeathPenalty) %>% 
  tidyr::drop_na(., c(Education, DeathPenalty))
dim(gss2002)

gss_summary <- gss2002 %>%
  mutate(
    Education = factor(
      Education,
      levels = c("Bachelors", "Graduate", "Jr Col", "HS", "Left HS"),
      labels = c("Bachelors", "Graduate", "Jr Col", "HS", "Left HS")
    ),
    DeathPenalty = as.factor(DeathPenalty)
  ) %>%
  group_by(Education, DeathPenalty) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>% # This is good for a chisq test
  
  # Add two more columns to faciltate mosaic/Marrimekko Plot
  # 
  mutate(edu_count = sum(count), 
         edu_prop = count / sum(count)) %>%
  ungroup() 

gss_summary

# We can plot a heatmap-like `mosaic chart` for this table, using `ggplot`:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19233365/how-to-create-a-marimekko-mosaic-plot-in-ggplot2

ggplot(data = gss_summary, aes( x = Education, y = edu_prop)) +
  geom_bar(aes(width = edu_count, fill = DeathPenalty), stat = "identity", position = "fill", colour = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(edu_prop)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +


# if labels are desired
 facet_grid(~ Education, scales = "free_x", space = "free_x") + 
  theme(scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdYlGn")) + 
  # theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(0, "npc")) + # if no spacing preferred between bars
  theme_void() 

```
 Let us now perform the base `chisq test`: We need a `table` and then the `chisq` test:
 
```{r}

gss_table <- tally(DeathPenalty ~ Education, data = gss2002)
gss_table

# Get the observed chi-square statistic
observedChi2 <- mosaic::chisq(tally(DeathPenalty ~ Education, data = gss2002))
observedChi2

# Actual chi-square test
stats::chisq.test(tally(DeathPenalty ~ Education, data = gss2002))

```

We should now repeat the test with permutations on `Education`:

```{r}

null_chisq <- do(10000) * chisq.test(tally(DeathPenalty ~ shuffle(Education), data = gss2002))

head(null_chisq)

gf_histogram( ~ X.squared, data = null_chisq) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = observedChi2, color = "red")

gf_histogram( ~ p.value, data = null_chisq, binwidth = 0.1, center = 0.05)
```
So we would conclude that `Education` has a significant effect on `DeathPenalty` opinion!
