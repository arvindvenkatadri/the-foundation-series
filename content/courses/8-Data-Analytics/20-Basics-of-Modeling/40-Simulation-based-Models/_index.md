## Introduction

In this set of modules we will explore using Random Number Generation and Monte Carlo Simulations and see how Business Outcomes that are dependent upon on Random Inputs can be estimated with confidence. 

The the basic concepts here is the use of a simulation model, which is a computer representation of a problem that involves random variables. The chief advantage of a simulation model of a problem is that the simulation model can forecast the consequences of various management decisions before such decisions must be made. Simulation models are used in a very wide variety of management settings, including modeling of manufacturing operations, modeling of service operations where queues form (such as in banking, passenger air travel, food services, etc.), modeling of investment alternatives, and analyzing and pricing of sophisticated financial instruments. A simulation model is an extremely useful tool to help a manager make difficult decisions in an environment of uncertainty.

The fundamental way of thinking about Simulation-based Statistical Tests is shown in the Figure below.

This is not a new idea, but has been made possible only after the late 1970s or so, after compute power became adequate to mechanize what is suggested in the Figure. 

Before we jump into Simulation-based Models, let us quickly listen to this short talk by John Rauser:
