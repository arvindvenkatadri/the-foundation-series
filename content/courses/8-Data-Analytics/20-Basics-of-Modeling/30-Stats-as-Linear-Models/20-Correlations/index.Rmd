## The Linear Model

The premise here is that **many common statistical tests are special cases of the linear model**. A **linear model** estimates the relationship between dependent variable or "response" variable ($y$) and an explanatory variable or "predictor" ($x$). It is assumed that the relationship is **linear**. $\beta_0$ is the *intercept* and $\beta_1$ is the slope of the linear fit, that **predicts** the value of y based the value of x. 

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 *x
$$ 




## The Correlation Test

TBD: Some introductory text here on Correlation itself)

One of the basic Questions we would have of our data is:
Does some variable depend upon another in some way?
Does $y$ depend upon $x$?

A **Correlation Test** is designed to answer exactly this question. 
   
Let us now see how a Correlation Test can be re-formulated as
a Linear Model + Hypothesis Test.

### Some Toy Data

Most examples in this exposition are based on three "imaginary" samples,
$x, y1, y2$. Each is normally distributed and made up of 50 observations. The means and the sds are, respectively:


```{r data_genr}
rnorm_fixed  <- function(N, mu = 0, sd = 1) {
  scale(rnorm(N))* sd + mu
}
params <- tibble(mu = c(0, 0.3, 0.5), sd = c(1,2,1.5))
params 
```

```{r toy_data}
set.seed(40) # for replication

# Data as vectors ( for t.tests etc)
x <- rnorm_fixed(50, mu = 0.0, sd = 1) #explanatory
y1 <- rnorm_fixed(50, mu = 0.3, sd = 2) # dependent #1
y2 <- rnorm_fixed(50, mu = 0.5, sd = 1.5) # dependent #2

# Make a tibble with all variables
mydata_wide <- tibble(x = x, y1 = y1, y2 = y2)

# Long form data
mydata_long <- 
  mydata_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(., cols = c(x,y1,y2), 
               names_to = "group", 
               values_to = "value")

# Long form data with only dependent variables
mydata_long_y <- 
  mydata_wide %>% 
  select(-x) %>% 
  pivot_longer(., cols = c(y1,y2), 
               names_to = "group", 
               values_to = "value")
```

Let us look at our toy data in three ways:

1. All three variables:

```{r} 
mydata_wide 
```

2. Variables stacked and labelled
(Note: `group` is now a Qual variable !!)

```{r}
mydata_long 
```

3. Same as 2, but only for the dependent `y` variables:

```{r}
mydata_long_y 
```


# Tests for Correlation

Correlation **r** is a measure of *strength* and *direction* of *linear association* between two variables. **r** is between $[-1,+1]$, with $0$ implying no association/correlation.

From this definition, the *linear model* lends itself in a straightforward way as a model to interpret *correlation*. Intuitively, the slope of the linear model could be related to the correlation between y and x.

Now we look at the numbers.

## Pearson Correlation

### Model

The model for Pearson Correlation tests is exactly the Linear Model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x\\
\\
H_0: Null\ Hypothesis\ => \beta_1 = 0\\\
H_a: Alternate\ Hypothesis\ => \beta_1 \ne 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$


```{r Pearson_Correlation}
# Pearson (built-in test)
cor <- cor.test(y1,x,method = "pearson") %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% mutate(term = "Pearson Correlation r") %>% select(term, estimate, p.value) 
cor 


```

Using the *linear model* method we get:

```{r}
# Linear Model
lin <- lm(y1 ~ 1 + x, data = mydata_wide) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% mutate(term = c("beta_0", "beta_1")) %>% select(term, estimate, p.value)
lin 

```

Why are $r$ and $\beta_1$ different, though the `p-value` is suspiciously the same!? 

Did we miss a factor of $\frac{-0.463}{-0.231} = 2$ somewhere...??

Let us **scale** the variables to within `{-1, +1}` : (subtract the mean and divide by sd) and re-do the Linear Model with **scaled** versions $x$ and $y$:

```{r}
# Scaled linear model
lin_scl <- lm(scale(y1) ~ 1 + scale(x), data = mydata_wide) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% mutate(term = c("beta_0", "beta_1")) %>% select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% select(term, estimate, p.value)
lin_scl 

```

So we conclude:

1. **When both x and y have the same standard deviation, the slope from the linear model and the Pearson correlation are the same**. Here, since x has twice the `sd` of y, the ratio of **slope** = `r lin$estimate[2]` to **r** = `r cor$estimate` is 0.5. 

1. There is this relationship between the **slope in the linear model** and **Pearson correlation**:

$$
Slope\ \beta_1 = \frac{sd_y}{sd_x} * r
$$

The slope is usually much more interpretable and informative than the correlation coefficient.

2. Hence a linear model using `scale()` for both variables will show slope = **r**.

Slope_Scaled: `r lin_scl$estimate[2]` = Correlation: `r cor$estimate`

3. Finally, the *p-value* for Pearson Correlation and that for the *slope* in the linear model is the same ($0.1053$). Which means we cannot reject the NULL hypothesis of "no relationship".


### Example

TBD

## Spearman Correlation

### Model

In some cases the **LINE** assumptions may not hold. 

Nonlinear relationships, non-normally distributed data ( with large **outliers** ) and working with *ordinal* rather than continuous data: these situations necessitate the use of Spearman's *ranked* correlation scores. (**Ranked**, not **sign-ranked**.). 

See the example below: We choose to look at the `gpa_study_hours` dataset. It has two numeric columns `gpa` and `study_hours`:

```{r gpa_study_hours}
glimpse(gpa_study_hours)

```

We can plot this:

```{r Pearson_example_3}

ggplot(gpa_study_hours, aes(x = study_hours, y = gpa)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_minimal()
# ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats(data = gpa_study_hours, 
#                             x = study_hours, 
#                             y = gpa,
#                             marginal = TRUE,
#                             title = "GPA vs Study Hours")

```


Hmm...not normally distributed, and there is a sort of increasing relationship, however is it linear? And there is some evidence of heteroscedasticity, so the LINE assumptions are clearly in violation. Pearson correlation would not be the best idea here. 

Let us quickly try it anyway, using a Linear Model for the **scaled** `gpa` and `study_hours` variables, from where we get: 

```{r Pearson_example_1}


# Pearson Correlation as Linear Model
model_gpa <-
  lm(scale(gpa) ~ 1 + scale(study_hours), data = gpa_study_hours)

model_gpa %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(term = c("beta_0", "beta_1")) %>% 
  cbind(confint(model_gpa) %>%                                              as_tibble()) %>%  
  select(term, estimate, p.value, `2.5 %`, `97.5 %`)

```

The correlation estimate is $0.133$; the `p-value` is $0.065$ (and the
`confidence interval` includes $0$). 

Hence we fail to reject the NULL hypothesis that `study_hours` and `gpa` have no relationship. But can this be right? 

Should we use another test, that does not **need** the LINE assumptions?


## "Signed Rank" Values

Most statistical tests use the **actual values** of the data variables.
However, in some *non-parametric* statistical tests, the data are used
in **rank-transformed** sense/order. (In some cases the **signed-rank**
of the data values is used instead of the data itself.)

**Signed Rank** is calculated as follows:

1. Take the absolute value of each observation in a sample

2. Place the <u>*ranks*</u> in order of (absolute magnitude). The
smallest number has *rank = 1* and so on. This gives is **ranked data**. 

3. Give each of the ranks the sign of the original observation ( + or -). This gives us **signed** ranked data. 

```{r signed_rank_function}
signed_rank <- function(x) {sign(x) * rank(abs(x))}

```

## Plotting Original and Signed Rank Data

Let us see how this might work by comparing data and its signed-rank version...A quick set of plots:

```{r data_plots}
p1 <- ggplot(mydata_long,aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.02, height = 0,aes(colour = group), size = 4) +
  geom_segment(data = mydata_wide, aes(y = 0, yend = 0, 
                                       x = .75, 
                                       xend = 1.25 )) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 0.5, label = "0")) +
  geom_segment(data = mydata_wide, aes(y = 0.3, yend = 0.3, 
                                       x = 1.75 , 
                                       xend = 2.25 )) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 2, y = 0.6, label = "0.3")) +
  geom_segment(data = mydata_wide, aes(y = 0.5, yend = 0.5, 
                                       x = 2.75, 
                                       xend = 3.25 )) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 3, y = 0.8, label = "0.5")) +
  labs(title = "Original Data", subtitle = "Black Lines show Means") +
  ylab("Response Variable")

p2 <- mydata_long %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  mutate( s_value = signed_rank(value)) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = group, y = s_value)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.02, height = 0,aes(colour = group), size = 4) + 
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", colour = "red", 
               size = 8) + 
  labs(title = "Signed Rank of Data", subtitle = "Red Points are means of Ranks!") +
  ylab("Signed Rank of Response Variable")

patchwork::wrap_plots(p1,p2, nrow = 1, guides = "collect")

```

So the means of the **ranks** three separate variables seem to be in the same order as the means of the data variables themselves.

How about associations between data? Do ranks reflect well what the data might? 



```{r Spearman_Plot}
# Plot the data
p1 <- ggplot(mydata_wide, aes(x, y1)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle(" Pearson Correlation\n and Linear Models")

# Plot ranked data
p2 <- mydata_wide %>% 
  mutate(x_rank = rank(x),
         y_rank = rank(y1)) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(x_rank, y_rank)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 15, size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  ggtitle(" Spearman Ranked Correlation\n and Linear Models")

patchwork::wrap_plots(p1,p2, nrow = 1, guides = "collect")

```


The slopes are almost identical, $0.25$ for both original data and ranked data for $y1\sim x$. So maybe *ranked* and even *sign_ranked* data could work, and if it can work despite LINE assumptions not being satisfied, that would be nice!

## How does Sign-Rank data work?

TBD: need to add some explanation here.

Spearman correlation = Pearson correlation using the rank of the data
observations. Let's check how this holds for a our x and y1 data:

So the Linear Model for the Ranked Data would be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times rank(x)\\
\\
H_0: Null\ Hypothesis\ => \beta_1 = 0\\\
H_a: Alternate\ Hypothesis\ => \beta_1 \ne 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

### Code

```{r Spearman_Correlation}
# Spearman
cor1 <- cor.test(x,y1, method = "spearman") %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% mutate(term = "Spearman Correlation ") %>% select(term, estimate, p.value)
cor1

```

```{r}
# Pearson using ranks
cor2 <- cor.test(rank(y1), rank(x), method = "pearson") %>% 
broom::tidy() %>% select(estimate, p.value)
cor2
```


```{r}
# Linear Models using rank
cor3 <- lm(rank(y1) ~ 1 + rank(x),data = mydata_wide) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% select(estimate, p.value)
cor3
```


Notes:

1. When ranks are used, the slope of the linear model ($\beta_1$) has the same value as the Spearman correlation coefficient ( $\rho$ ).
    
1. Note that the slope from the linear model now has an intuitive interpretation: **the number of ranks y changes for each change in rank of x**. ( Ranks are "independent" of `sd` )

### Example

We examine the `cars93` data, where the numeric variables of interest
are `weight` and `price`.

```{r Spearman_example_1}
cars93 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(weight, price)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, lty = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Car Weight and Car Price have a nonlinear relationship")
```

Let us try a Spearman Correlation score for these variables, since the
data are not linearly related and the variance of `price` also is not
constant over `weight`

```{r Spearman_example_2}
cor.test(cars93$price, cars93$weight, method = "spearman") %>% broom::tidy()

# Using linear Model
lm(rank(price) ~ rank(weight), data = cars93) %>% summary()

# Stats Plot
ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats(data = cars93, x = weight, 
                            y = price,
                            type = "nonparametric",
                            title = "Cars93: Weight vs Price",
                            subtitle = "Spearman Correlation")
```

We see that using ranks of the `price` variable, we obtain a Spearman's
$\rho = 0.882$ with a `p-value` that is very small. Hence we are able to
reject the NULL hypothesis and state that there is a relationship
between these two variables. The **linear** relationship is evaluated as
a correlation of `0.882`.
