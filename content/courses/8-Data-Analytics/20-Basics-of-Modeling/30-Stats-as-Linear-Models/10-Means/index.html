abstract: This module is intended to assist with making statistically significant insights that drive business decisions. This document deals with the basics of stats. The method followed is that of Jonas Lindoloev, wherein every stat test is treated as a linear model `y = mx + c`.

<h2>The Test for a Single Mean</h2>
<p>We start with the simplest of models for inference: a single mean.</p>
<p>To reiterate our purpose: We have a sample of data, which comes from a
certain unknown population. We want to know if <em>the mean of the</em>
sample* is close to the mean of the population, and if so how close*.
We want to obtain a <strong>point estimate</strong> for the <strong>population parameter
(mean)</strong> and also a <strong>confidence interval</strong> as to how good our point
estimate is.</p>
<p>We will do this two ways: one with a standard statistical test, and then
with our hopefully more intuitive linear model</p>
<p>Let us now see how this Test for a Single Mean can be re-formulated as a
Linear Model + Hypothesis Test. The one-sample test is the same as a
linear model containing a dependent variable, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and a constant only.
That is, a model with the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y = \beta_0 \\
H_0:\ \beta_0 = 0\\
H_a:\ \beta_0 \ne 0
\]</span></p>
<p>This is the same as the equation from the <em>Linear Model</em> introduced at
the start<br />
but having dropped the last term. This is shown graphically below.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In order to estimate whether this sample is good for us to estimate
with, we need to check on two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a random sample? Are the samples chosen independently of each
other from the population? ( Here we assume it is so )</li>
<li>Is the sample itself normally distributed? This we can check:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Looks reasonably OK. We know that when the sample size is reasonably
high ($ n &gt;=30 $) we are likely to get a normal distribution. We will
deal with smaller sample sizes shortly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RULES OF THUMB: HOW TO PERFORM THE NORMALITY CHECK There is no perfect
way to check the normality condition, so instead we use two rules of
thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>n &lt; 30: If the sample size n is less than 30 and there are no
clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come
from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.</li>
<li>n ≥ 30: If the sample size n is at least 30 and there are no
particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the
sampling distribution of ¯x is nearly normal, even if the
underlying distribution of individual observations is not.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<div id="the-standard-t-test" class="section level2">
<h2>The Standard <em>t</em>-test</h2>
<p>Using the CLT for our single mean, we see that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>Point Estimate</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> = 0.5.</p></li>
<li><p>Standard Error SE = <span class="math inline">\(\sigma /\sqrt(n)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately we do not know the population parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> : that is
what we want to find out!! So, now? We use the standard deviation
<strong>computed</strong> from the <strong>sample</strong> s = 0.6 and state that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
SE\ = \sigma/\sqrt(n)\ ~ \sim s/\sqrt(n)\\
where\ s = SD(sample) = 0.6/\sqrt(30) = 0.1095
\]</span></p>
<p>This works very well when we have lots of data ($n&gt;= 30$), and the
sample distribution is also normal. Proceeding in this way, we can
calculate the <em>Confidence Intervals</em> as follows: assuming we want 95%
confidence intervals:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
CI\ = \pmb\pm 1.96*SE + \bar{y} \\
= [\pmb \pm 1.96 * 0.1095 + 0.5] = [0.39, 0.60]
\]</span></p>
<p>When the sample size is smaller, the sample distribution may not be
normal, and we use another distribution that fits the bill, called
<em>t</em>-distribution:</p>
