## Introduction

In this set of modules we will explore using Random Number Generation and Monte Carlo Simulations and see how Business Outcomes that are dependent upon on Random Inputs can be estimated with confidence. 

The fundamental way of thinking about Simulation-based Statistical Tests is shown in the Figure below.

This is not a new idea, but has been made possible only after the late 1970s or so, after compute power became adequate to mechanize what is suggested in the Figure. 

Before we jump into Simulation-based Models, let us quickly listen to this short talk by John Rauser:
