# Structure of this document

We will follow the following structure: Each kind of Test is described
in a separate Chapter. The Test *Model* is laid out in formula
$y = mx + c$ and in *Code*.

# The Linear Model

The premise here is that **many common statistical tests are special cases of the linear model**. So what *is* the linear model?

A **linear model** estimates the relationship between dependent variable or "response" variable ($y$) and an explanatory variable or "predictor" ($x$). 

(It is also possible that there is more than one explanatory variable: this is **multiple regression.**. We will get there later).

It is assumed that the relationship is **linear**:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 *x
$$ 

$\beta_0$ is the *intercept* and $\beta_1$ is the slope of the linear fit, that **predicts** the value of y based the value of x. 

Each prediction leaves a small "residual" error between the actual and predicted values. $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are calculated based on minimizing the *sum of square*s of these residuals, and hence this method is called "ordinary least squares" regression.

![Least Squares](images/OLS.png)


The net *area* of all the shaded squares is minimized in the calculation
of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. 

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1*x_1 + \beta_2*x_2 ...+ \beta_n*x_n
$$

where each of the $\beta_i$ are slopes defining the relationship between
y and $x_i$. Together, the RHS of that equation defines an n-dimensional
*plane*.

As per Lindoloev, many statistical tests, going from one-sample t-tests
to two-way ANOVA, are special cases of this system.

linear-model-can-be-fit-to-data-with-continuous-discrete-or-categorical-x-variables"](https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/applied-biostatistics_bookdown/_book/intro-linear-models.html#a-linear-model-can-be-fit-to-data-with-continuous-discrete-or-categorical-x-variables)

## Linear Models as Hypothesis Tests

Using linear models is based on the idea of **Testing of Hypotheses**.
The Hypothesis Testing method typically defines a NULL Hypothesis where
the statements read as "**there is no relationship**" between the
variables at hand, explanatory and responses. The Alternative Hypothesis
typically states that there *is* a relationship between the variables.

Accordingly, in fitting a linear model, we follow the process as
follows:

1.  Make the following hypotheses: $$
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 *x \\
    NULL\ Hypothesis\ H_0 => x\ and\ y\ are\ unrelated.\ (\beta_1 = 0)
    $$ $$
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 *x \\
    Alternate\ Hypothesis\ H_1 => x\ and\ y\ are\ linearly\ related\ (\beta_1 \ne 0)
    $$
2.  We "assume" that $H_0$ is true.
3.  We calculate $\beta_1$.
4.  We then find probability **p** that [$\beta_1 = Estimated\ Value$]
    **when the NULL Hypothesis** is **assumed** TRUE. This is the
    **p-value**. If that probability is **p\>=0.05**, we say we "cannot
    reject" $H_0$ and there is unlikely to be significant linear
    relationship.

However, if **p\<= 0.05** can we reject the NULL hypothesis, and say
that there could be a significant linear relationship,because
$\beta_1 = Estimated\ Value$ by mere chance under $H_0$ is very small.


## Assumptions in Linear Models

1.  **L**: $\color{blue}{linear}$ relationship
2.  **I**: Errors are **independent** (across observations)
3.  **N**: y is $\color{red}{normally}$ distributed at each "level"
    of x.
4.  **E**: equal variance at all levels of x. No *heteroscedasticity*.
    ![OLS Assumptions](images/ols_assumptions.png)

Let us now see which standard statistical tests can be re-formulated as
Linear Models.

# Data

## Sample Values

Most examples in this exposition are based on three "imaginary" samples,
$x, y, y2$. Each is normally distributed and made up of 50 observations. The means are ($mu = c(0,0.3,0.5)$), and the sds ($sd = c(1,2,1.5)$) are 


```{r data_genr}
rnorm_fixed  <- function(N, mu = 0, sd = 1) {
  scale(rnorm(N))* sd + mu
}
params <- tibble(mu = c(0, 0.3, 0.5), sd = c(1,2,1.5))
params
```

```{r toy_data}
set.seed(40) # for replication

# Data as vectors ( for t.tests etc)
x <- rnorm_fixed(50, mu = 0.0, sd = 1) #explanatory
y1 <- rnorm_fixed(50, mu = 0.3, sd = 2) # dependent #1
y2 <- rnorm_fixed(50, mu = 0.5, sd = 1.5) # dependent #2

# Make a tibble with all variables
mydata_wide <- tibble(x = x, y1 = y1, y2 = y2)

# Long form data
mydata_long <- 
  mydata_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(., cols = c(x,y1,y2), 
               names_to = "group", 
               values_to = "value")

# Long form data with only dependent variables
mydata_long_y <- 
  mydata_wide %>% 
  select(-x) %>% 
  pivot_longer(., cols = c(y1,y2), 
               names_to = "group", 
               values_to = "value")
```

Let us look at our toy data in three ways:

```{r} 
mydata_wide
```


```{r}
mydata_long
```


```{r}
mydata_long_y
```

## "Signed Rank" Values

Most statistical tests use the **actual values** of the data variables.
However, in some *non-parametric* statistical tests, the data are used
in **rank-transformed** sense/order. In some cases the **signed-rank**
of the data values is used instead of the data itself.

Signed Rank is calculated as follows:\
1. Take the absolute value of each observation in a sample\
2. Place the <u>*ranks*</u> in order of (absolute magnitude). The
smallest number has *rank = 1* and so on.\
3. Give each of the ranks the sign of the original observation ( + or -
)

```{r signed_rank_function}
signed_rank <- function(x) {sign(x) * rank(abs(x))}
```

## Plotting Original and Signed Rank Data

A quick plot:

```{r data_plots}
p1 <- ggplot(mydata_long,aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.02, height = 0,aes(colour = group), size = 4) +
  geom_segment(data = mydata_wide, aes(y = 0, yend = 0, 
                                       x = .75, 
                                       xend = 1.25 )) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 0.5, label = "0")) +
  geom_segment(data = mydata_wide, aes(y = 0.3, yend = 0.3, 
                                       x = 1.75 , 
                                       xend = 2.25 )) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 2, y = 0.6, label = "0.3")) +
  geom_segment(data = mydata_wide, aes(y = 0.5, yend = 0.5, 
                                       x = 2.75, 
                                       xend = 3.25 )) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 3, y = 0.8, label = "0.5")) +
  labs(title = "Original Data") +
  ylab("Response Variable")

p2 <- mydata_long %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  mutate( s_value = signed_rank(value)) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = group, y = s_value)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.02, height = 0,aes(colour = group), size = 4) + 
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", colour = "red", 
               size = 8) + 
  labs(title = "Signed Rank of Data") +
  ylab("Signed Rank of Response Variable")

patchwork::wrap_plots(p1,p2, nrow = 1, guides = "collect")

```

## How does Sign-Rank data work?

TBD: need to add some explanation here.

# Tests for Correlation {.tabset}

Correlation **r** is a measure of *strength* and *direction* of *linear
association* between two variables. **r** is between [-1,+1], with 0
implying no association/correlation.

From this definition, the *linear model* lends itself in a
straightforward way as a model to interpret *correlation*. Intuitively,
the slope of the linear model could be related to the correlation
between y and x.

Now we look at the numbers.

## Pearson Correlation {.tabset}

### Model

The model for Pearson Correlation tests is exactly the Linear Model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x 
\\
H_0: \beta_1 = 0
$$

See the Code section for further insights into the relationship between
the Correlation Score and the Slope of the Linear Model.

### Code

```{r Pearson_Correlation}
# Pearson (built-in test)
cor <- cor.test(y1,x,method = "pearson") %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% select(estimate, p.value)

# Linear Model
lin <- lm(y1 ~ 1 + x, data = mydata_wide) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% select(estimate, p.value)

# Scaled linear model
lin_scl <- lm(scale(y1) ~ 1 + scale(x), data = mydata_wide) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% select(estimate, p.value)

print(cor)
print(lin)
print(lin_scl)

# All together
rbind(cor, lin, lin_scl) %>% print()

```

Notes: 1. The *p-value* for Pearson Correlation and that for the *slope*
in the linear model is the same ( 0.1053 ). Which means we cannot reject
the NULL hypothesis of "no relationship".

2.  Here is the relationship between the slope and correlation:

$$
Slope\ \beta_1 = \frac{sd_y}{sd_x} * r
$$

When both x and y have the same standard deviation, the slope and
correlation are the same. Here, since x has twice the `sd` of y, the
ratio of **slope** = `r lin$estimate[2]` to **r** = `r cor$estimate` is
0.5. Hence a linear model using `scale()` for both variables will show
slope = **r**.

Slope_Scaled: `r lin_scl$estimate[2]` = Correlation: `r cor$estimate`

### Example

We choose to look at the `gpa_study_hours` dataset. It has two numeric
columns `gpa` and `study_hours`:

```{r gpa_study_hours}
glimpse(gpa_study_hours)
```

```{r Pearson_example_1}
# Checks for Normal/Symmetric distributions
p1 <- ggplot(gpa_study_hours) + geom_histogram(aes(gpa))
p2 <- ggplot(gpa_study_hours) + geom_histogram(aes(study_hours))
p3 <- ggplot(gpa_study_hours) + geom_point(aes(gpa, study_hours))
(p1 + p2) / p3

```

Hmm...not normally distributed, and the relationship is also not linear,
and there is some evidence of heterscedasticity, so Pearson correlation
would not be the best idea here.

```{r Pearson_example_2}

# Pearson Correlation as Linear Model
lm(gpa ~ study_hours, data = gpa_study_hours) %>% summary()

# Other ways using other packages
mosaic::cor_test(gpa ~ study_hours, data = gpa_study_hours)

statsExpressions::corr_test(data = gpa_study_hours, 
                            x = study_hours, 
                            y = gpa)
```

The correlation estimate is $0.133$; the `p-value` is 0.065 and the
confidence interval includes 0. Hence we fail to reject the NULL
hypothesis that `study_hours` and `gpa` have no relationship.

We can use a later package `ggstaplot` to plot this:

```{r Pearson_example_3}

ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats(data = gpa_study_hours, 
                            x = study_hours, 
                            y = gpa,
                            type = "robust",
                            marginal = TRUE,
                            title = "GPA vs Study Hours")

```

## Spearman Correlation

### Model

In some cases the **LINE** assumptions may not hold. Nonlinear
relationships, non-normally distributed data ( with large outliers ) and
working with *ordinal* rather than continuous data: these situations
necessitate the use of Spearman's *ranked* correlation scores.
(**Ranked**, not **sign-ranked**.)

$$
rank(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * rank(x) \\
H_0: \beta_1 = 0
$$

Spearman correlation = Pearson correlation using the rank of the data
observations. Let's check how this holds for a our x and y data:

```{r Spearman_Plot}
# Plot the data
p1 <- ggplot(mydata_wide, aes(x, y1)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle(" Pearson Correlation\n and Linear Models")

# Plot ranked data
p2 <- mydata_wide %>% 
  mutate(x_rank = rank(x),
         y_rank = rank(y1)) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(x_rank, y_rank)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 15, size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  ggtitle(" Spearman Ranked Correlation\n and Linear Models")

patchwork::wrap_plots(p1,p2, nrow = 1, guides = "collect")
```

Slopes are almost identical, \~ 0.25.

### Code

```{r Spearman_Correlation}
# Spearman
cor1 <- cor.test(y1,x, method = "spearman") %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% select(estimate, p.value)

# Pearson using ranks
cor2 <- cor.test(rank(y1), rank(x), method = "pearson") %>% 
broom::tidy() %>% select(estimate, p.value)

# Linear Models using rank
cor3 <- lm(rank(y1) ~ 1 + rank(x),data = mydata_wide) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% select(estimate, p.value)

rbind(cor1, cor2, cor3) %>% print()
```

Notes:

1.  When ranks are used, the slope of the linear model ($\beta_1$) has
    the same value as the correlation coefficient ( $\rho$ ).

2.  Note that the slope from the linear model now has an intuitive
    interpretation: **the number of ranks y changes for each change in
    rank of x**. ( Ranks are "independent" of `sd` )

### Example

We examine the `cars93` data, where the numeric variables of interest
are `weight` and `price`.

```{r Spearman_example_1}
cars93 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(weight, price)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, lty = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Car Weight and Car Price have a nonlinear relationship")
```

Let us try a Spearman Correlation score for these variables, since the
data are not linearly related and the variance of `price` also is not
constant over `weight`

```{r Spearman_example_2}
cor.test(cars93$price, cars93$weight, method = "spearman") %>% broom::tidy()

# Using linear Model
lm(rank(price) ~ rank(weight), data = cars93) %>% summary()

# Stats Plot
ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats(data = cars93, x = weight, 
                            y = price,
                            type = "nonparametric",
                            title = "Cars93: Weight vs Price",
                            subtitle = "Spearman Correlation")
```

We see that using ranks of the `price` variable, we obtain a Spearman's
$\rho = 0.882$ with a `p-value` that is very small. Hence we are able to
reject the NULL hypothesis and state that there is a relationship
between these two variables. The **linear** relationship is evaluated as
a correlation of `0.882`.

## Conclusion
Hopefully, interpreting Statistical Tests in terms of the Linear Model has benefits of improved intuitive understanding.
