<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Now that we have gotten a handle on <span class="citation">@Descriptive</span> Analytics, <span class="citation">@Predictive</span> Analytics, @ Modelling, <span class="citation">@Statistical</span> Analysis, and <span class="citation">@Optimization</span>, it is time to put all that work together in a convincing poster/presentation!</p>
<p>There are many ways of doing this, of course. We will be following a very intuitive <code>package</code> in R, called <code>flexdashboard</code>. This package allows us to make Posters that include code, analysis, description, and of course pictures to weave a convincing story for upper management!</p>

<p>Flexdashboards are created using just another format of RMarkdown. So letâ€™s look at the lab above and modify that to suit our own needs. There are also many other formats and even R graph types that we can use in flexdashboard. Do look at the examples later !</p>
