### Introduction: Mixing Colours

Interpolation:   

 - between TWO colours, both colours inclusive using a straight line between them  
 - between several different colours?  
    - by mixing "equal proportions" of each  
    - Proportions based on "distance" from each colour  
    - On a "plane" with these points  


### Some Examples from Drama

1. Legally Blonde: 

`r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "aVRUfPRUKtU")`

2. Greek Chorus Explained: 

`r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "orXPMdCU-6s")`

3. Sutradhar in Indian Drama

### Discussion

- Interpolation
- Extrapolation
- Calculating the *optimum * values for **m** and **c**, given **x and **y**, for $y = mx + c$

### Playing with Orange: Paint My Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height= "250px", out.width= "350px"}

knitr::include_graphics("LinearRegression.png")

```

Let us "draw inspiration" from the picture above, and see if we can replicate it. We will fire up Orange, **paint some data** and see if we can fit a **linear regression ML model** to it. 

Here is the Orange file for you to download. Open <u>[**this file**](LinearRegression.ows)</u> in Orange. 


### Regression Plane

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library("plot3D")

# x, y, z variables
x <- mtcars$wt
y <- mtcars$disp
z <- mtcars$mpg
# Compute the linear regression (z = ax + by + d)
fit <- lm(z ~ x + y)
# predict values on regular xy grid
grid.lines = 26
x.pred <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = grid.lines)
y.pred <- seq(min(y), max(y), length.out = grid.lines)
xy <- expand.grid( x = x.pred, y = y.pred)
z.pred <- matrix(predict(fit, newdata = xy), 
                 nrow = grid.lines, ncol = grid.lines)
# fitted points for droplines to surface
fitpoints <- predict(fit)
# scatter plot with regression plane
scatter3D(x, y, z, pch = 18, cex = 2, 
    theta = 20, phi = 20, ticktype = "detailed",
    xlab = "wt", ylab = "disp", zlab = "mpg",  
    surf = list(x = x.pred, y = y.pred, z = z.pred,  
    facets = NA, fit = fitpoints), main = "mtcars")
```


### Interactive Regression Plane

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#load data

my_df <- penguins %>% drop_na()
penguin_lm <- lm(body_mass_g ~ 0 + flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm, data = my_df)
```


```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#Graph Resolution (more important for more complex shapes)
graph_reso <- 0.5

#Setup Axis
axis_x <- seq(min(my_df$flipper_length_mm), max(my_df$flipper_length_mm), by = graph_reso)
axis_y <- seq(min(my_df$bill_length_mm), max(my_df$bill_length_mm), by = graph_reso)

#Sample points
penguin_lm_surface <- expand.grid(flipper_length_mm = axis_x, bill_length_mm = axis_y,KEEP.OUT.ATTRS = F)
penguin_lm_surface$body_mass_g <- predict.lm(penguin_lm, newdata = penguin_lm_surface)
penguin_lm_surface <- acast(penguin_lm_surface, bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_mm, value.var = "body_mass_g") #y ~ x

```


```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
hcolors=c("red","blue","green")[my_df$species]
penguins_plot <- plot_ly(my_df, 
                     x = ~flipper_length_mm, 
                     y = ~bill_length_mm, 
                     z = ~body_mass_g,
                     text = ~species, # EDIT: ~ added
                     type = "scatter3d", 
                     mode = "markers",
                     marker = list(color = hcolors)) %>% 
                     layout(title = "Penguins: Body Mass predicted by Flipper Length and Bill Length")

## and then add the surface:

penguins_plot <- add_trace(p = penguins_plot,
                       z = penguin_lm_surface,
                       x = axis_x,
                       y = axis_y,
                       type = "surface")

penguins_plot

```
