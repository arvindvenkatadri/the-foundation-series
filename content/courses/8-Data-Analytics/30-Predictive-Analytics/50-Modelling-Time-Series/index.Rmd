## Introduction

In this module we will look at modelling of time series. We will start with the simplest of *expoential* models and go all the way through **ARIMA** and forecasting with **Prophet**.

First, some terminology!


##  Additive and Multiplicative Time Series Models

Additive Time Series can be represented as:

$$
Y_t = S_t + T_t + ϵ_t
$$


Multiplicative Time Series can be described as:

$$
Y_t = S_t × T_t × ϵ_t
$$


Let us consider a *Multiplicative Time Series*, pertaining to sales of souvenirs at beaches in Australia: The time series looks like this:


```{r Multiplicative-Model,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
souvenir <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/data/fancy.dat")

# souvenirtimeseries <- ts(souvenir, frequency = 12,start = c(1987,1), end = c(1993, 12))
# plot.ts(souvenirtimeseries)
# 
souvenir %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "time") %>% 
  plot_time_series(., time, value)

```

Note that along with the trend, the amplitude of both *seasonal* and *noise* components are also increasing in a *multiplicative* here !! A multiplicative time
series can be converted to additive by taking a `log` of the time series.



## Stationarity

A time series is said to be stationary if it holds the following
conditions true:

1.  The mean value of time-series is constant over time, which implies,
    the trend component is nullified/constant.
2.  The variance does not increase over time.
3.  Seasonality effect is minimal.

This means it is devoid of trend or seasonal patterns, which makes it
looks like a random white noise irrespective of the observed time
interval.( i.e. self-similar and fractal)



## A Bit of Forecasting?

We are always interested in the future. We will do this in three ways:

-   use Simple Exponential Smoothing
-   use a package called `forecast` to fit an ARIMA (Autoregressive
    Moving Average Integrated Model) model to the data and make
    predictions for weekly sales;
-   And do the same using a package called `prophet`.

### Forecasting using Exponential Smoothing

For example, the file contains total annual rainfall in inches for
London, from 1813-1912 (original data from Hipel and McLeod, 1994).

```{r}

rain <- scan("https://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/hurst/precip1.dat", skip = 2)
rainseries <- ts(rain, start = c(1813))
plot(rainseries)

```


There is a nearly constant value of about 25 around which there are
random fluctuations and it seems to be an additive model. How can we make 
forecasts with this time series? 



**A deliberate detour:**

Let's see some quick **notation** to aid understanding: Much of smoothing is based on the high school concept of a straight line, $ y = m * x + c$. 

In the following, we choose to describe the models with:

- $y$ : the actual values in the time series
- $\hat y$ : our predictions from whichever model we create
- $l$ : a *level* or *mean* as forecast; 
- $b$ : a *trend* variable; akin to the *slope* in the straight line equation;
- $s$ : seasonal component of the time series. Note that this is a 
*set of values* that stretch over one *cycle* of the time series. 

In Exponential Smoothing and Forecasting, we make three models of increasing complexity:

1. Simple Exponential Model: Here we deal only with the mean or *level* aspect of the (decomposed) time series and make predictions with that.

2. Holt Model: Here we use the `level` and the `trend` from the decomposed time series for predictions

3. Holt-Winters Model: Here we use the `level`, the `trend`, and the `seasonal` component from the decomposed time series for predictions.

**Simple Smoothing** is smoothing based forecasting using just the *level* ( i.e. mean) of the Time Series to make forecasts. 


**Double exponential** smoothing, or *Holt Smoothing Model*, is just exponential smoothing applied to both level and trend. 

The idea behind **triple exponential smoothing**, or the *Holt-Winters Smoothing Model*, is to apply exponential smoothing to the seasonal components in addition to level and trend. 

**What does "Exponential" mean?**

All three models use **memory**: at each time instant in the Time Series, a set of past values, along with the present sample is used to make a prediction of the relevant parameter ( level / slope / seasonal). These are then added together to make the **forecast**.

The memory in each case controlled by a parameter: `alpha` for the estimate of the level 
`beta` for the slope estimate, and `gamma` for the seasonal component estimate at the current time point. All these parameters are between `0` and `1`. The model takes a **weighted average** of past values of each parameter. The weights are derived in the form of $\alpha(1-\alpha)^i$, where $i$ defines how old the sample is compared to the present one, thus forming a set of weights that decrease *exponentially* with delay. Values of $\alpha, \beta. \gamma$ that are close to 0 mean that significant weightage is placed on observations in the past.(Memory is "stronger").To express this in mathematical notation we now need three equations: one for level, one for the trend and one to combine the level and trend to get the expected $\hat y$ .

To make forecasts using simple exponential smoothing in R, we can use the `HoltWinters()` function in R, or the `forecast::ets()` function from `forecasts`. This latter function s more powerful. 


```{r,What is Holt-Winters smoothing?}

args(HoltWinters)
args(ets)

```

To use `HoltWinters()` for simple exponential smoothing, we need to
set the parameters `beta=FALSE` and `gamma=FALSE` in the
`HoltWinters()` function (the beta and gamma parameters are used for
double exponential smoothing, or triple exponential smoothing.

To use `forecast::ets`, we set the `model` argument to "ANN", "AAN", and "AAA" respectively for each of the three smoothing models. 

Note: The `HoltWinters()` function returns a list variable, that contains
several named elements.

```{r Applying Holt-Winters}

rainseriesforecasts <- forecast::ets(rainseries, model = "ANN")
# class(rainseriesforecasts)
# str(rainseriesforecasts)
plot(rainseriesforecasts)

plot(forecast(rainseriesforecasts, 10))

```

#### ARIMA

We can also use past trends and seasonality in the data to make
predictions about the future using the forecast package. Here we use an
auto ARIMA model to guess at the trend in the time series. Then we use that 
model to forecast a few periods into the future. 

Mathematically an ARIMA model can be shown as follows:


```{nomnoml}


```


We will use the familiar Walmart Sales dataset, and try to predict weekly sales for one of the Departments.

```{r ARIMA}

data("walmart_sales_weekly")
walmart_wide <- walmart_sales_weekly %>% 
  pivot_wider(., id_cols = c(Date), names_from = Dept, values_from = Weekly_Sales,names_prefix = "Sales_")

## forecast::auto.arima needs a SINGLE time series, so we pick one, Dept95
sales_95_ts <- walmart_wide %>% select(Sales_95) %>% ts(start = c(2010,1), end = c(2012,52),frequency = 52)
sales_95_ts

arima_dept_95 <- forecast::auto.arima(y = sales_95_ts)
arima_dept_95
plot(arima_dept_95)


# Use the model to forecast 12 weeks into the future
sales95_forecast <- forecast(arima_dept_95, h = 12)

# Plot the forecast. Again, we can use autoplot.
autoplot(sales95_forecast) +
  theme_minimal()

```

We're fairly limited in what we can actually tweak when using
`autoplot()`, so instead we can convert the forecast object to a data
frame and use ggplot() like normal:

```{r Plotting Forecast with ggplot}

# Get data out of this weird sales95_forecast object
sales95_forecast
sales95_forecast_tidy <- sweep::sw_sweep(sales95_forecast, 
                                         fitted = TRUE, 
                                         timetk_idx = TRUE)

sales95_forecast_tidy

# For whatever reason, the date column here is a special type of variable called
# "yearmon", which ggplot doesn't know how to deal with (like, we can't zoom in
# on the plot with coord_cartesian). We use zoo::as.Date() to convert the
# yearmon variable into a regular date
sales95_forecast_tidy_real_date <- sales95_forecast_tidy %>% 
  mutate(actual_date = zoo::as.Date(index, frac = 1))
sales95_forecast_tidy_real_date

## Stuck here!! 1975 !!! What the hell!!!
## 
## 
# Plot this puppy!
ggplot(sales95_forecast_tidy_real_date, aes(x = actual_date, y = value, color = key)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lo.95, ymax = hi.95), 
              fill = "#3182bd", color = NA) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lo.80, ymax = hi.80, fill = key), 
              fill = "#deebf7", color = NA, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "sales95") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  # Zoom in on 2012-2016
  coord_cartesian(xlim = ymd(c("2012-01-01", "2016-01-01"))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```
