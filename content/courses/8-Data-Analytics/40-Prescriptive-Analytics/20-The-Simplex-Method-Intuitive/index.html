<h2>A <del>Random</del> Walk with the Simplex Method</h2>
<p>Let us try to form a geometric intuition for the Simplex method.</p>
<p>We will define an LP problem, and geometrically traverse the steps the
Simplex method might take to solve for the optimum solution.</p>
<p>Let us define a problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Maximise\ 7.75x_1 + 10x_2\\
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
Subject\ to\\
  \begin{cases}
    C1: -3x_1 + 2x_2 &amp;&lt;= 3\\
    C2: 2x_1 + 4x_2 &amp;&lt;= 27\\
    C3: 9x_1 + 10x_2 &amp;&lt;= 90\\
    x_1, x_2 &gt;= 0
  \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>The Objective function is: <span class="math inline">\(7.75x_1 + 10x_2\)</span></p>
<p>The Constraints are defined by the three <em>inequalities</em> <span class="math inline">\(C1::C3\)</span>. In
order to plot these, we <em>convert the inequalities to equalities</em> and
plot these as lines. Each line splits the <span class="math inline">\(x_1:x_2\)</span> plane into two
half-planes. The inequality part is then taken into account by choosing
the appropriate <em>half-plane</em> created by the equation. The <em>intersection</em>
of all the half-planes defined by the constraints is the <strong>Feasibility
Region</strong>.</p>
<p>The Feasibility region for this LP problem is plotted below:</p>
<p><img src="images/SimplexMethod-1.png" width="1500" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The corner points of the Feasibility Region are:</p>
<pre><code>#   name     x1     x2
# 1    A  0.000 0.0000
# 2    B 10.000 0.0000
# 3    C  5.625 3.9375
# 4    D  2.625 5.4375
# 5    E  0.000 1.5000</code></pre>
<p>Recall that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The optimum in an LP problem is found <strong>on</strong> the boundary, at one of
the vertices</li>
<li>At each of these vertices one or more constraints (<span class="math inline">\(C1::C_n\)</span>) is
<em>tight</em>, i.e. there is no slack.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="procedure" class="section level2">
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We start with an arbitrary point on the edge of the Feasibility
Region. <span class="math inline">\(A = (0,0)\)</span> is a common choice. At this point, since all
variables are <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, the objective function is also <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We (arbitrarily) decide to <strong>move along the boundary</strong> of the
Feasibility Region, to another FSP. We arbitrarily chose the <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>
axis, and set/keep <span class="math inline">\(x_2 = 0\)</span>. We now wish to find out the <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>
coordinate of the next FSP point. This would be at the intersection
of the <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> axis and <em>one of</em> the Constraint lines.<br />
All the three Constraint Lines would possibly intersect the <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>
axis. We need to choose that <em>intercept point</em> that has the
smallest, non-negative <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> intercept value. (Why?)<br />
So, which <em>Constraint Line</em> intersects the <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> axis at the
<strong>smallest value</strong>? Is it point B, or point F?<br />
To find out, we substitute <span class="math inline">\(x_2 = 0\)</span> in each of the Constraint
equations, and solve for the <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>:<br />
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{cases}
C1: -3x_1 + 2 \times 0 = 3 \ =&gt; x_1 = \color{red}{-1}\\
C2: 2x_1 + 4\times0 = 27 \ =&gt; x_1 = 13.5\ Point\ F\\
   {\mathbf{ \color{lightgreen}{C3}: 9x_1 + 10\times0 = 90 \ =&gt; x_1 = 10\  \color{lightgreen}{Point\ B}}}
\end{cases}
\]</span><br />
Negative values for any variable are not permitted. So the smallest
value of intercept is <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = 10\)</span> for Constraint <span class="math inline">\(C3\)</span>. We therefore
move to point <span class="math inline">\(B(10,0)\)</span>. At this point the objective function has
improved to:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Objective = 7.75\times 10 + 10\times0 = 77.5\ at\ Point\ B
\]</span></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We now start from Point B, and move to the next nearest point. In
identical fashion to Step2, we “imagine” that we move along <em>a new
axis</em> defined by:<br />
<span class="math display">\[
Intercept = Point\ B(10,0)\\
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
Equation = Constraint\ C3: 9x_1 + 10x_2 = 90\\
\]</span> We express <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(C3\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\hat C3: x_1 = \frac{90 - 10x_2}{9}
\]</span> As in Step 2, we substitute this equation <span class="math inline">\(\hat C3\)</span> into the
other two constraints, <span class="math inline">\(C1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C2\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{cases}
C1: -3\times \frac{90 - 10x_2}{9} + 2x_2 = 3 \ =&gt; x_2 = 6.18\ Point\ K\\
{\mathbf{ \color{lightgreen}{C2}: 2\times \frac{90 - 10x_2}{9}+ 4x_2 = 27 =&gt; x_2 = 3.93\ \color{lightgreen}{Point\ C}}}
\end{cases}
\]</span> As before we choose the smaller of the two intercepts, so
<span class="math inline">\(x_2 = 3.93\)</span>. Calculating for <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, we get point <span class="math inline">\(C(5.63, 3.93)\)</span>.
At this point the objective function has improved to:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
7.75\times 5.63 + 10\times 3.93 = 82.9\ at\ Point\ C
\]</span></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We now proceed along the constraint line <span class="math inline">\(C2\)</span> towards the next
point. In identical fashion to Step 2 and 3, we “imagine” that we
move along <em>a new axis</em> defined by: <span class="math display">\[
Intercept = Point\ C(5.63,3.93)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
Equation = Constraint\ C2: 2x_1 + 4x_2 = 27 \\
\]</span> Again, We express <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(C2\)</span> this time: <span class="math display">\[
\hat C2: x_1 = \frac{27 - 4x_2}{2}
\]</span> As in Step 2 and, we substitute this equation <span class="math inline">\(\hat C2\)</span> into the
other constraint, the only remaining <span class="math inline">\(C1\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
{\mathbf C1: -3\times \frac{27 - 4x_2}{2} + 2x_2 = 3 \ =&gt; x_2 = 5.44\ Point\ D\\}
\]</span> Calculating for <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, we get point <span class="math inline">\(C(2.63, 5.44)\)</span>. At this
point the objective function has <del>improved</del> decreased to: <span class="math display">\[
7.75\times 2.63 + 10\times 5.44 = 74.8\ at\ Point\ D
\]</span> Since this value for the Objective function is <strong>smaller</strong> than
that at the previous point, our search terminates and we decide that
Point <span class="math inline">\(C(5.63,3.93)\)</span> is the optimal point.<br />
So the final result is: <span class="math display">\[
   x_1(max) = 5.63\\
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
   x_2(max) = 3.93\\
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
   Maximum\ Objective\ Function\ Value = 82.9
\]</span> The final result is plotted below:</li>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The essence of this “intuitive method” can be captured as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start from a known simple point on the edge of Feasibility Region,
e.g. (0,0), since the two coordinate axes frequently form two edges
to the Feasibility Region.<br />
</li>
<li>Move along one of the axis to find a first adjacent edge point. This
adjacent point corresponds to the “tightening” of one or other of
the Constraint equations(i.e. slack = 0 for that Constraint)<br />
</li>
<li>Calculate the Objective function at that point.<br />
</li>
<li>Use this new point as the next starting point and move along the
Constraint line from the previous step.<br />
</li>
<li>Repeat step 2 and 3, calculating the Objective function each time.<br />
</li>
<li>Keep the solution point where the objective function hits a maximum,
i.e. when moving to the next point <em>reduces</em> the value of the
Objective function.</li>
</ol>
