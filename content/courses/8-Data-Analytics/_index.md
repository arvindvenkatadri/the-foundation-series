## Abstract

This Course takes Business Practitioners on a journey of Business Analytics: using data to derive insights, make predictions, and decide on plans of action that can be communicated and actualized in a Business context.

> "Business analytics, or simply analytics, is the use of data, information technology, statistical analysis, quantitative methods, and mathematical or computer-based models to help managers gain improved insight about their business operations and make better, fact-based decisions. Business analytics is"a process of transforming data into actions through analysis and insights in the context of organizational decision making and problem solving."<div style="text-align: right"> - Libertore and Luo, 2010 </div>

<br> The Course starts with **Descriptive Analytics**: Datasets from various domains of Business enterprise and activity are introduced. The datasets are motivated from the point of view of the types of information they contain: students will relate the Data Variables (Qualitative and Quantitative) to various types of Data/Information Visualizations.

**Statistical Concepts** such as ***Sampling, Hypothesis Tests, Simulation / Modelling, and Uncertainty*** will be introduced.

**Predictive Analytics** will take us into looking at Data and training standard ML algorithms to make predictions with new Data. ***Regression, Clustering, and Classification*** will be covered.

**Prescriptive Analytics** will deal with coming to terms with the uncertainty in Predictions, and using tools such as both ***ML, Linear/non-Linear Programming, and Decision-Making*** to make Business Decisions, with an assessment of the Risks involved.

The Course will culminate in a full **Business Analytics Workflow** that includes Data Gathering and Cleaning, Descriptive and Predictive Analytics, Prescriptive Analytics and Decision Making, and Communication resulting in a publication-worthy documents.(HTML / PDF/ Word)
