All operations are done using a visual menu-driven interface. The visuals can be exported to PNG/SVG/PDF and the entire workflow can be exported into a Report Form and edited for presentation and sharing. 


## Installing Radiant

You can download and install Radiant from here:

<https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/install.html>

NOTE: 
- this automatically installs R, RStudio, and Radiant on your machine. This is going to be convenient when we start working in R too!
- It also installes Latex, which allows us to create crisp PDF reports of our analyses.
