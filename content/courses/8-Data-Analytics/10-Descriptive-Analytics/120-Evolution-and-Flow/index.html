<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What do we mean by “evolution” here?
We mean data that changes in <em>category</em> or <em>membership</em> over <em>time</em> or <em>space</em>. The dataset may contain only categories and the time and space parameters may be implicit.
For example: what does the graph below depict?</p>
</div>
<div id="what-time-evolution-charts-can-we-plot" class="section level2">
<h2>What Time Evolution Charts can we plot?</h2>
<p>In these cases, the x-axis is typically <em>time</em>…and we chart the variable of another Quant variable with respect to time, using a <em>line</em> geometry.</p>
<p>Let is take a healthcare budget dataset from<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID">Our World in Data</a>: We will plot graphs for 5 countries (India, China, Brazil, Russia, Canada )</p>

</div>
<div id="what-space-evolution-charts-can-we-plot" class="section level2">
<h2>What Space Evolution Charts can we plot?</h2>
<p>Here, the <em>space</em> can be any Qual variable, and we can chart another Quant or Qual variable move across levels of the first chosen Qual variable.</p>
<p>For instance we can contemplate Enrollment at a University, and show how students move from course to course in a University. Or how customers drift from one category of products or brands to another….or the movement of cricket players from one IPL Team to another !!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sankey diagram is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another. The things being connected are called <strong>nodes</strong> and the connections are called <strong>links</strong>.
Sankeys are best used when you want to show a many-to-many mapping between two domains or multiple paths through a set of stages.</p>

<p>Here is another example of a Sankey Diagram:This diagram show how energy is converted or transmitted before being consumed or lost: supplies are on the left, and demands are on the right. Data: Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change via Tom Counsell</p>
