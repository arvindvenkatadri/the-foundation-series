# Introduction

What do we mean by "evolution" here?
We mean data that changes in *category* or *membership* over *time* or *space*. The dataset may contain only categories and the time and space parameters may be implicit.

A visual example: what does the graph below depict?

This diagram show how energy is converted or transmitted before being consumed or lost: supplies are on the left, and demands are on the right. (Data: UK Department of Energy & Climate Change via Tom Counsell)

An example in words: Students opting for different courses during a semester at college. What axes would you include in your plot?


# Packages that we will need

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(ggstream) # stream plots in R
library(ggalluvial)

```




## Time Evolution Charts

In these cases, the x-axis is typically *time*...and we chart the variable of another Quant variable with respect to time, using a *line* geometry. 

Let is take a healthcare budget dataset from[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID): We will plot graphs for 5 countries (India, China, Brazil, Russia, Canada ). Download this data by clicking the button below and save into your Project folder.





```{r read-data, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
health <-
  read_csv("data/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID.csv")

```


```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(downloadthis)
health %>%
  download_this(
    output_name = "mtcars dataset",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download data as csv",
    button_type = "info",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-save"
  )

```




```{r plot-data}

health_filtered <- health %>%
  filter(Entity %in% c(
    "India",
    "China",
    "United States",
    "United Kingdom",
    "Russia",
    "Sweden"
  ))


p1 <- ggplot(health_filtered,
         aes(x = Year, 
             y = public_health_expenditure_pc_gdp, 
             colour = Entity)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(y = "Healthcare Budget\n as % of GDP")

p2 <-  
  ggplot(health_filtered,
         aes(x = Year, 
             y = public_health_expenditure_pc_gdp, 
             fill = Entity)) + geom_area() + 
  labs(y = "Healthcare Budget\n as % of GDP")


p1 / p2 + plot_layout(nrow = 2) + 
  plot_annotation(title = "Line and Area Charts to show Evolution (over Time )",
                  subtitle = "", 
                  tag_levels = 'A') & 
  theme_minimal()

```


## What Space Evolution Charts can we plot?

Here, the *space* can be any Qual variable, and we can chart another Quant or Qual variable move across levels of the first chosen Qual variable.

For instance we can contemplate Enrollment at a University, and show how students move from course to course in a University. Or how customers drift from one category of products or brands to another....or the movement of cricket players from one IPL Team to another !!

> A sankey diagram is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another. The things being connected are called **nodes** and the connections are called **links**. 
Sankeys are best used when you want to show a many-to-many mapping between two domains or multiple paths through a set of stages.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sankey.png")

```

Let us look at the famous Titanic Dataset:

```{r more-charts, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(ggalluvial)
data("Titanic")
Titanic %>% as_tibble() %>% 
ggplot(data = .,
       aes(axis1 = Class, axis2 = Sex, axis3 = Age,
           y = n)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Survived)) +
  geom_stratum() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Class", "Sex", "Age"), 
                   expand = c(.2, .05)) +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +
  xlab("Demographic") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("passengers on the maiden voyage of the Titanic",
          "stratified by demographics and survival")
```




## Conclusion

Evolution can be over *time*, or over *space/categories/affiliations* or *both*, where the time part is implicit in the way the categories are depicted. 


## Your Turn

1. Head off to the [International Energy Agency's](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets) webpage for free Energy related datasets. Plot Sankey and Time Graphs for a dataset of your choice. 

1. Download the *Chinese Companies' Cashflow* Dataset from [**Kaggle.com**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscofeng/chinese-companies-cash-flow). Choose a few companies from the list and plot *time evolution* and *Sankey Diagrams* for their various cash flows.
