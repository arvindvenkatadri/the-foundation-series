<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What is a network?</p>
<p>Network graphs show relationships between entities: what sort they are,
how strong they are, and even of they change over time.</p>
<p>We will examine data structures pertaining both to the <em>entities</em> and
the <em>relationships</em> between them and look at the data <em>object</em> that can
combine these aspects together. Then we will see how these are plotted,
what the <em>structure</em> of the plot looks like. There are also <em>metrics</em>
that we can calculate for the network, based on its structure. We will
of course examine geometric metaphors that can represent various classes
of entities and their relationships.</p>
<p>Network graphs can be rendered both as static and interactive and we
will examine R packages that render both kinds of plots.</p>
<p>There is a another kind of structure: one that combines <em>spatial</em> and
<em>network</em> data in one. We will defer that for a future module !</p>

<h2>What kind Network graphs will we make?</h2>
<p>Here is a network map of the characters in Victor Hugo’s

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We see that Networks reveal <em>Structure</em> of relationships between entities, their types and strengths, and also reveal behavioural aspects as to which entities or relationships are important which are peripheral to the overall network.</p>
