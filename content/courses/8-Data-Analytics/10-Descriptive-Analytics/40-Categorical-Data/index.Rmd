## Introduction

To recall, a categorical **variable** is one for which the possible
measured or assigned values consist of a discrete set of categories,
which may be `ordered` or `unordered`. Some typical examples are:

-   Gender, with categories "Male," "Female."
-   Marital status, with categories "Never married," "Married,"
    "Separated," "Divorced," "Widowed."
-   Fielding position (in ~~baseball~~ cricket), with categories
    "Slips,"Cover ","Mid-off "Deep Fine Leg", "Close-in", "Deep"...
-   Side effects (in a pharmacological study), with categories "None,"
    "Skin rash," "Sleep disorder," "Anxiety," . . ..
-   Political attitude, with categories "Left," "Center," "Right."
-   Party preference (in India), with categories "BJP" "Congress,"
    "AAP," "TMC."...
-   Treatment outcome, with categories "no improvement," "some
    improvement," or "marked improvement."
-   Age, with categories "0--9," "10--19," "20--29," "30--39," . . . .
-   Number of children, with categories 0, 1, 2, . . . .

As these examples suggest, categorical variables differ in the number of
categories: we often distinguish binary variables (or dichotomous
variables) such as Gender from those with more than two categories
(called polytomous variables).

## Categorical Data

From the `{vcd package}` vignette:

> The first thing you need to know is that categorical data can be
> represented in **three different forms in R**, and it is sometimes
> necessary to convert from one form to another, for carrying out
> statistical tests, fitting models or visualizing the results.

-   Case Data
-   Frequency Data
-   Cross-Tabular Count Data

Let us first see examples of each.

### Case Form

Containing *individual observations* with one or more **categorical**
factors, used as classifying variables. The total number of observations
is `nrow(X)`, and the number of variables is `ncol(X)`.

```{r Arthritis-Dataset}

names(Arthritis)
class(Arthritis)
glimpse(Arthritis)

```

From Michael Friendly [Discrete Data Analysis and Visualization](/pdf/DataAnalytics/Michael-Friendly-DDAS.pdf) :

> In many circumstances, data is recorded on each individual or
> experimental unit. Data in this form is called case data, or data in
> case form.

```{r, case-form-data, echo=FALSE}

head(Arthritis) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Arthritis Treatments and Effects (first 6 entries)",centering = TRUE) %>%
  kable_classic_2(html_font = "Cambria", full_width = F,)

```

The `Arthritis` data set has three factors and two integer\* variables.
One of the three factors `Improved` is an **ordered factor**.

1)  ID
2)  Treatment: a factor; Placebo or Treated
3)  Sex: a factor, M / F
4)  Age: integer
5)  Improved: **Ordinal factor**; None \< Some \< Marked

### Frequency Data

Data in frequency form has already been tabulated, by counting over the
(combinations of ) categories of the table variables. When the data are
in **case form**, we can always trace any observation back to its
individual identifier or data record, since each row is a unique
observation or *case*; the reverse is rarely possible.

Frequency Data is usually a data frame, with columns of categorical
variables and at least one column containing `frequency` or `count`
information.

```{r}
str(GSS)
GSS %>% 
  kbl(caption = "General Social Survey",centering = TRUE) %>%
  kable_classic_2(html_font = "Cambria", full_width = F,)

```

Respondents in the GSS survey were classified by `sex` and `party`
identification.

### Table form

> Table Form Data can be a `matrix`, `array` or `table object`, whose
> elements are the frequencies in an **n-way table**. The variable names
> (factors) and their levels are given by `dimnames(X)`.

```{r Table-Form, results='hold'}

HairEyeColor
class(HairEyeColor)

```

`HairEyeColor` is a "two-way" table, consisting of **two tables**, one
for `Sex = Female` and the other for `Sex = Male`. The total number of
observations is `sum(X)`. The number of dimensions of the table is
`length(dimnames(X))`, and the table sizes are given by
`sapply(dimnames(X), length)`. The data looks like a n-dimensional cube
and needs n-way tables to represent.

```{r exploring-tables,results='hold'}

sum(HairEyeColor)
dimnames(HairEyeColor)
sapply(dimnames(HairEyeColor), length)

```

We may need to convert the (multiple) tables into a data frame:

```{r tables-to-data-frame}

## Convert the two tables into a data frame
HairEyeColor %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% # Convert
  head() %>% # Take first few rows to show
  kbl(caption = "Hair Eye and Color (First 6 Entries)") %>% 
  kable_classic_2(html_font = "Cambria", full_width = F)

```

## Creating Contingency Tables

Most plots for Categorical Data ( as we shall see ) require that the data be converted into a *Contigency Table*; even Statistical tests for Proportions ( the $ \chi^2 $ test ) need Contingency Tables. The *Frequency Table* we encountered earlier is very close to being a full-fledged Contingency Table. 

In this section we understand how to make Contingency Tables from each of the three forms.


## What sort of Plots can we make for Categorical Data?

We have already seen bar plots, which allow us to plot counts of categorical data. However, if there are a large number* of categorical variables or if thecategorical variables have many levels, the bar plot is not adequate. 

From Michael Friendly:

> The familiar techniques for displaying raw data are often
> disappointing when applied to categorical data. The simple
> scatterplot, for example, widely used to show the relation between
> quantitative response and predictors, when applied to discrete
> variables, gives a display of the category combinations, with all
> identical values overplotted, and no representation of their
> frequency.

> Instead, frequencies of categorical variables are often best
> represented graphically using **areas** rather than as **position
> along a scale**. Using the visual attribute:

$$\pmb{area \sim frequency}$$

> allows creating novel graphical displays of frequency data for special
> circumstances.

Let us not look at some sample plots that embody this "area-frequency\*
principle.

### Mosaic Plots

A mosaicplot is basically an area-proportional visualization of (typically observed) frequencies, consisting of tiles (corresponding to the cells) created by vertically and horizontally splitting a rectangle recursively. Thus, the area of each tile is proportional to the corresponding cell entry given the dimensions of previous splits.

The `vcd::mosaic()` function needs the data in *contingency table* form. We will use `vcd::structable()` function to construct one:

```{r mosaic-plot-using-vcd}

art <- vcd::structable(~ Treatment + Improved, data = Arthritis)
art
vcd::mosaic(art, gp = shading_max)

### Or
### vcd::mosaic(structable(~ Treatment + Improved, data = Arthritis), gp = shading_max, split_vertical = TRUE)
 

```

### Balloon Plots

```{r balloon-plot-using-ggpubr}
housetasks <- read.delim(
  system.file("demo-data/housetasks.txt", package = "ggpubr"),
  row.names = 1
  )
head(housetasks, 4)

ggballoonplot(housetasks, fill = "value")+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C")


```

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)
ggballoonplot(df, x = "Hair", y = "Eye", size = "Freq",
              fill = "Freq", facet.by = "Sex",
              ggtheme = theme_bw()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C")

```

### Plots for Likert Data

In many business situations, we perform surveys to get Likert scale
data, where several respondents rate a product or a service on a scale
of `Very much like`, `somewhat like`, `neutral`, `Dislike` and
`Very much dislike`. Such data may look for example as follows:

```{r}
data(efc)
head(efc, 20)
```

`efc` is a German data set from a European study on family care of older people.  Following a common protocol, data were collected from national samples of approximately 1,000 family carers (i.e. caregivers) per country and clustered into comparable subgroups to facilitate cross-national analysis. One of the *research questions* in [**this EUROFAM study**](https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/48.6.752) was:

> What are the main difficulties carers experience accessing the services
used? 
What prevents carers from accessing unused
supports that they need? 
What causes them to stop using still-needed services?

We will select the variables from the `efc` data set that related to *coping* (on part of care-givers) and plot their responses after inspecting them:

```{r}
efc %>% select(dplyr::contains("cop")) %>% str()

```

The `cop`ing related variables have responses on the Likert Scale `(1,2,3,4)` which correspong to `(never, sometimes, often, always)`,  **and** each variable also has a `label` defining each variable. We can plot this data using the `plot_likert` function from package `sjPlot`:

```{r}

efc %>% select(dplyr::contains("cop")) %>% 
  sjPlot::plot_likert(title = "Caregiver Survey from EUROFAM")

```

So there we are with Categorical data ! There are a few other plots with this type of data, which are useful in very specialized circumstances. One example of this is the `agreement plot` which captures the agreement between two (sets) of evaluators, on ratings given on a shared ordinal scale to a set of items. An example from the field of medical diagnosis is the opinions of two specialists on a common set of patients. 

## Conclusion

How are these bar plots different from histograms? 
Why don't "regular" plots simply work for Categorical data?
Discuss!
