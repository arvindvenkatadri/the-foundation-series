<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So let us start with “eating humble pie”: <sub>creating</sub> discussing a Pie chart first.</p>
<p>A <code>pie chart</code> is a circle divided into sectors that each represent a proportion of the whole. It is often used to show percentage, where the sum of the sectors equals 100%. The problem is that humans are pretty bad at reading angles. This ubiquitous chart is much vilified in the industry and <code>bar charts</code> that we have seen earlier, are viewed as better options. However do read this spirited defense of pie charts here. <a href="https://speakingppt.com/why-tufte-is-flat-out-wrong-about-pie-charts/" class="uri">https://speakingppt.com/why-tufte-is-flat-out-wrong-about-pie-charts/</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, pie charts are ubiquitous in business circles, so there is an attractive alternative, called a <code>fan chart</code> which we will explore here.</p>
<p>We will try to depict here the interesting ones such as the <code>dendrogram</code>, the <code>parliament plot</code>, the <code>waffle plot</code>, and the <code>circle packing</code> chart.</p>
<div id="fan-plot" class="section level3">
<h3>Fan Plot</h3>
<p>Base R has a simple <code>pie</code> command that does the job.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pie.sales &lt;- c(0.12, 0.3, 0.26, 0.16, 0.04, 0.12)
labels &lt;- c(&quot;Blueberry&quot;, &quot;Cherry&quot;,
    &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Boston Cream&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;, &quot;Vanilla Cream&quot;)
pie(x = pie.sales, labels = labels,col =  grDevices::hcl.colors(palette= &quot;Plasma&quot;, n = 6)) # default colours</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" />
The <code>fan plot</code> displays numerical values as arcs of <strong>overlapping sectors</strong>. This allows for more effective comparison:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plotrix::fan.plot(x = pie.sales, labels = labels,
                  col = grDevices::hcl.colors(palette= &quot;Plasma&quot;, n = 6),
                  shrink = 0.03, # How much to shrink each successive sector
                  label.radius = 1.15,
                  main = &quot;Fan Plot of Ice Cream Flavours&quot;,
                  ticks = 360,
                  max.span = pi)</code></pre>

<div id="parliament-and-waffle-charts" class="section level2">
<h2>Parliament and Waffle Charts</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>parts &lt;- c(80, 30, 20, 10)
waffle(parts, rows=8)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
