# Introduction

We will create Data Visualizations in R to show Parts ofa Whole. As always, we will consistently use the [**Project Mosaic**](https://mosaic-web.org)
ecosystem of packages in R (`mosaic`, `mosaicData` and `ggformula`). 
Some specialized plots ( e.g. Fan Plots) may require us to load other R Packages. These will be introduced appropriately. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = T, comment = "#>", echo = TRUE)
options(tibble.print_min = 4L, tibble.print_max = 4L)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic) # package for stats, simulations, and basic plots
library(mosaicData) # package containing datasets
library(ggformula) # package for professional looking plots, that use the formula interface from mosaic
library(NHANES) # survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
library(plotrix)

```

Recall the standard method for all commands from the `mosaic` package:

goal( y \~ x \| z, data = mydata, ...)

## Case Study -1: Greenhouse Gas by Industry

I have downloaded this data from Our World in Data: <https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector>

Let us inspect import this data and inspect it: 

```{r}
ghg <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/Global-GHG-Emissions-by-sector-based-on-WRI-2020.xlsx")
inspect(ghg)
```

Hmm...The names of the columns are bit unwieldy, so let's clean them up:

```{r}
ghg <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/Global-GHG-Emissions-by-sector-based-on-WRI-2020.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  dplyr::rename("share" = share_of_global_greenhouse_gas_emissions_percent) %>% 
  mutate(sub_sector = as_factor(sub_sector))
inspect(ghg)

```

This is a simple pre-aggregated dataset, with one categorical column and one numerical column, perfectly suited to plotting Pies and Fans. We will use this variable to plot a Pie chart and the much better Fan chart.

```{r}
pie(ghg$share,labels = ghg$sub_sector,main = "Greenhouse Emissions by Industry")
```
Clearly this is messy...we will take the top 8 industries by emission and `lump` the rest into an `other` category:

```{r}

ghg <- ghg %>% mutate(sub_sector = fct_lump(sub_sector, prop = 0.1))
ghg
pie(ghg$share,labels = ghg$sub_sector,main = "Greenhouse Emissions by Industry")


```


### Stat Summaries

As Stigler said, **summaries** are the first thing to look at in data.
Let us tabulate some quick stat summaries of the important variables in
`Galton`:

```{r}
favstats(~ height, data = Galton)
favstats(~ height | sex, data = Galton)

```

Q.1 How many families in the data for each value of `nkids`? 

```{r}
tally(~ nkids, data = Galton)
```


Q.2. What is the break-up by `sex` of the child?

```{r}
tally(~ nkids | sex, data = Galton)
```


### Distribution Plots

What Questions might we have, that we could answer with a Distribution?

Q.1 How many families based on the number of children?

```{r}

# Convert the tally into a dataframe. See the difference!
family_count <- tally( ~ nkids | sex, data = Galton) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  
  # Convert nkids from char to int
  mutate( nkids = as.integer(nkids))
family_count
gf_col(n ~ nkids | sex, data = family_count, fill = ~ sex, ylab = "Number of Families", xlab = "Number of Kids / Family")
```


Q.2: How are the children's heights distributed?

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ height, data = Galton) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = mean(Galton$height))

```


Q.3: Is there a difference in height distributions between Male and Female children?

```{r}
measures <- favstats(~ height | sex, data = Galton)
measures

gf_histogram(~ height | sex, data = Galton) %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = ~ mean, data = measures)

```


Q.4: Are Mothers generally shorter than fathers?
```{r}
gf_density(~ father, data = Galton, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3) %>% 
  gf_density( ~ mother, data = Galton, fill = "red", alpha = 0.3, xlab = "Heights")
  
```


Q.5: Are heights of children different based on the number of kids in the family? For Male and Female children?

```{r}
gf_boxplot(height ~ sex | nkids, data = Galton)

```


Q.6: Does the **mean** height of children in a family vary with the number of children in the family? ( family size) 

```{r}
mean( height ~ sex | nkids, data = Galton) %>% as_tibble() # not very inspiring!
by_sex_nkids <- favstats( height ~ sex + nkids, data = Galton)
by_sex_nkids # much better!

```

```{r}
gf_col(mean ~ sex.nkids, data = by_sex_nkids)
```

Hmm...not a *very* informative plot...

## Case Study-2: Dataset from `NHANES`

Let us try the `NHANES` dataset. Try `help(NHANES)` in your Console. 

```{r}
data("NHANES")
names(NHANES)
```

### Stat Summaries
```{r}
mosaic::inspect(NHANES)
```

Again, lots of data from `inspect`, about the Quant and Qual variables. Spend a little time looking through the output of `inspect`. 
Which variables could have been data *given* by each respondent, and which ones could have been *measured* data variables? Why do you think so?  
Why is there so much *missing* data?  Which variable are the most affected by this?



```{r}
tally(Education ~ Work, data = NHANES)

```

### Distribution Plots
Q.1. What is the distribution of Physical Activity Days, across Gender? Across Education?
```{r}
gf_histogram(data = NHANES, ~ PhysActiveDays | Gender)
gf_histogram(data = NHANES, ~ PhysActiveDays | Education)

```

Q.1. How are people Ages distributed across levels of Education?
```{r}
gf_boxplot(Age ~ Education, data = NHANES)
```
Q.2. How is Education distributed over Race?
```{r}
gf_histogram()
```

Q.3 What is the distribution of people's BMI, split by Gender? By Race1?
```{r}
gf_histogram(~ BMI | Gender, data = NHANES)
gf_histogram(~ BMI | Race1 + Race3, data = NHANES)

```








## Case Study-3: A complete example

Here is a dataset from Jeremy Singer-Vine's blog, [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/). This is a list of all books banned in schools across the US. 

```{r, bar-charts}
banned <- readxl::read_xlsx(path = "data/banned.xlsx",
                            sheet = "Sorted by Author & Title")
banned

names(banned)
``` 
Clearly the variables are *all* Qualitative, except perhaps for *Date of Challenge/Removal, (which in this case has been badly mangled by Excel)
So we need to make **counts** based on the *levels* of the Qual variables and plot Bar/Column charts. 

Let us quickly make some Stat Summaries:

```{r}
mosaic::inspect(banned)
```

Let us try to answer this question: *What is the count of banned books by type and by US state?*

```{r}
banned_by_state <- banned %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(total = n()) %>% ungroup()
banned_by_state

banned %>% group_by(State, `Type of Ban`) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% left_join(., banned_by_state, by = c("State" = "State")) %>% 
 #  pivot_wider(.,id_cols = State,
 #              names_from = `Type of Ban`,
 #              values_from = count) %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% 
 #  replace_na(list(banned_from_libraries_and_classrooms = 0,
 #                  banned_from_libraries = 0,
 #                  banned_pending_investigation = 0,
 #                  banned_from_classrooms = 0)) %>% 
 # mutate(total = sum(across(where(is.integer)))) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(State, total), y = count, fill = `Type of Ban`)) + geom_col() + coord_flip()

```
