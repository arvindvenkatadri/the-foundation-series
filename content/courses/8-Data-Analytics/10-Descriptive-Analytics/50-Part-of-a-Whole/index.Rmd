# What Graphs will we see today?

There are a good few charts available to depict things that constitute
other bigger things. We will discuss a few of these: Pie, Fan, and
Donuts; Waffle and Parliament charts; Trees, Dendrograms, and Circle
Packings. 

We will begin with Pie Charts, Fan Plots, and Donuts. We will then try to depict here the interesting ones such as the `dendrogram`, the `parliament plot`, the `waffle plot`, and the `circle packing` chart. 



## Pies and Fans

So let us start with "eating humble pie": discussing a Pie chart first.

A `pie chart` is a circle divided into sectors that each represent a
proportion of the whole. It is often used to show percentage, where the
sum of the sectors equals 100%.

The problem is that humans are pretty bad at reading angles. This
ubiquitous chart is much vilified in the industry and `bar charts` that
we have seen earlier, are viewed as better options. However do read this
spirited defense of pie charts here.
<https://speakingppt.com/why-tufte-is-flat-out-wrong-about-pie-charts/>

On the other hand, pie charts are ubiquitous in business circles, and
are very much accepted ! So there is an attractive, and similar-looking
alternative, called a `fan chart` which we will explore here.

(Base) R has a simple `pie` command that does the job.

```{r}
pie.sales <- c(0.12, 0.3, 0.26, 0.16, 0.04, 0.12)
labels <- c("Blueberry", "Cherry",
    "Apple", "Boston Cream", "Other", "Vanilla Cream")
pie(x = pie.sales, labels = labels,col =  grDevices::hcl.colors(palette= "Plasma", n = 6)) # default colours

```


The `fan plot` displays numerical values as arcs of **overlapping sectors**. This allows for more effective comparison: 

```{r,echo=TRUE}
plotrix::fan.plot(x = pie.sales, labels = labels,
                  col = grDevices::hcl.colors(palette= "Plasma", n = 6),
                  shrink = 0.03, # How much to shrink each successive sector
                  label.radius = 1.15,
                  main = "Fan Plot of Ice Cream Flavours",
                  ticks = 360,
                  max.span = pi)


```


The `donut` chart suffers from the same defects as the pie, so should be
used with discretion. The `donut` chart is essentially a `geom_rect`
from ggplot, plotted on a **polar coordinate** set of of axes:

```{r donut-chart}

# Data
df <- data.frame(group = LETTERS[1:3],
                 value = c(25, 20, 35))

df <-
  df %>% dplyr::mutate(
    fraction = value / sum(value), # percentages
    ymax = cumsum(fraction), # cumulative percentages
    ymin = lag(ymax, 1, default = 0),
    # bottom edge of each
    label = paste0(group, "\n value: ", value),
    labelPosition = (ymax + ymin) / 2 # labels midway on arcs
  )

df

```


```{r}

ggplot(df) + 
# `geom_rect()` requires aesthetics: xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 2, xmax = 4, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax, fill = group),colour = "black") + 
  geom_label( x=3.5, aes(y=labelPosition, label= label), size=4) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y",direction = 1) + # Upto here will give us a pie chart

# When switching to polar coords:
# x maps to r
# y maps to theta
# so we create a "hole" in the radius, in in 
xlim(c(0,4)) + # try to play with the "0"
theme_void() +
theme(legend.position = "none")

```

## Parliament and Waffle Charts


Waffle charts are often called "square pie charts" !

```{r using-waffle, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages("waffle", repos = "https://cinc.rud.is")
library(waffle)

# Data
df <- data.frame(group = LETTERS[1:3],
                 value = c(25, 20, 35))

# Waffle plot
ggplot(df, aes(fill = group, values = value)) +
  geom_waffle(n_rows = 8, size = 0.33, colour = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = NULL,
                    values = c("#BA182A", "#FF8288", "#FFDBDD"),
                    labels = c("A", "B", "C")) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void() 

```

The package `ggpol` offers an interesting visualization in the shape of
a array of "seats" in a parliament. ( There is also a package called
`ggparliament` which in my opinion is a bit cumbersome, having a two
step procedure to convert data into "parliament form" etc. )

```{r using-ggpol}
df <- data.frame(group = LETTERS[1:3],
                 value = c(25, 20, 35))

# Parliament Plot
ggplot(df) +
  ggpol::geom_parliament(aes(seats = value, 
                             fill = group),
                         r0 = 2, # inner radius
                         r1 = 4 # Outer radius
  ) + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = NULL,
                    values = c("#BA182A", "#FF8288", "#FFDBDD"),
                    labels = c("A", "B", "C")) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void() 


```

## Trees, Dendrograms, and Circle Packings

There are still more esoteric plots to explore, if you are hell-bent on
startling people ! There is an R package called `ggraph`, that can do
these charts, and many more:

> ggraph is an extension of [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
> aimed at supporting relational data structures such as networks,
> graphs, and trees. While it builds upon the foundation of `ggplot2`
> and its API it comes with its own self-contained set of geoms, facets,
> etc., as well as adding the concept of *layouts* to the grammar.

We will explore these charts when we examine `network diagrams.` For
now, we can quickly see what these diagrams look like. Although the
R-code is visible to you, it may not make sense at the moment!

### Dendrograms

From the [R Graph Gallery
Website](http://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) :

> Dendrograms can be built from:
>
> -   [Hierarchical
>     dataset](http://r-graph-gallery.com/dendrogram.html#hiera): think
>     about a CEO managing team leads managing employees and so on.
>
> -   [Clustering
>     result](http://r-graph-gallery.com/dendrogram.html#clust):
>     clustering divides a set of individuals in group according to
>     their similarity. Its result can be visualized as a tree.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

# create an edge list data frame giving the hierarchical structure of your individuals
d1 <- data.frame(from="origin", to=paste("group", seq(1,5), sep=""))
d2 <- data.frame(from=rep(d1$to, each=5), to=paste("subgroup", seq(1,25), sep="_"))
edges <- rbind(d1, d2)
 
# Create a graph object 
mygraph1 <- tidygraph::as_tbl_graph( edges )
 
# Basic tree
p1 <- ggraph(mygraph1, layout = 'dendrogram', circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_diagonal() +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_void()


# create a data frame 
data <- data.frame(
  level1="CEO",
  level2=c( rep("boss1",4), rep("boss2",4)),
  level3=paste0("mister_", letters[1:8])
)
 
# transform it to a edge list!
edges_level1_2 <- data %>% select(level1, level2) %>% unique %>% rename(from=level1, to=level2)
edges_level2_3 <- data %>% select(level2, level3) %>% unique %>% rename(from=level2, to=level3)
edge_list=rbind(edges_level1_2, edges_level2_3)
 
# Now we can plot that
mygraph2 <- as_tbl_graph( edge_list )
p2 <- ggraph(mygraph2, layout = 'dendrogram', circular = FALSE) + 
  geom_edge_diagonal() +
  geom_node_point() +
  theme_void()

p1 + p2+ theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

### Circle Packing

```{r ,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
graph <- tbl_graph(flare$vertices, flare$edges)
set.seed(1)
ggraph(graph, 'circlepack', weight = size) + 
  geom_node_circle(aes(fill = as_factor(depth)), size = 0.25, n = 50) + 
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Depth") +
  theme_void()
```

# Your Turn

1.  Use the `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package and
    plot pies, fans, and donuts as appropriate.
2.  Look at the `whigs` and `highschool` datasets in the package
    `ggraph`. Plot Trees, Dendrograms, and Circle Packings as
    appropriate for these.
