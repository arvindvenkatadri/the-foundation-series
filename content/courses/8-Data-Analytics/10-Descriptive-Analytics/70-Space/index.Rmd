# Introduction


First; let us watch a short, noisy video on maps:

Maps That Will Change The Way You See The World:(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH2sAbXv7p4)

`r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "YH2sAbXv7p4")`

## What kind of maps will we make?

## A Workflow in Orange


## A Workflow in Radiant
Radiant does not support map-making. We need to do it one of the many many ways available in R directly!

## A Workflow in R


### 1. Animal and Bird Migration

1. Head off to [movebank.org](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main)
2. Look at a few species of interest and choose one.
3. Download the data ( **ESRI Shapefile**)
4. Import that into  R using `sf_read()`
5. See how you can plot locations, tracks and colour by species....based on the data you download.

### 2. UFO Sightings

Here is a UFO Sighting dataset, containing location and text descriptions. <https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports/blob/master/csv-data/ufo-scrubbed-geocoded-time-standardized.csv>
