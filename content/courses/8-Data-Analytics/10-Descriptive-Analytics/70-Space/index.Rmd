### 1. Animal and Bird Migration

1. Head off to [movebank.org](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main)
2. Look at a few species of interest and choose one.
3. Download the data ( **ESRI Shapefile**)
4. Import that into  R using `sf_read()`
5. See how you can plot locations, tracks and colour by species....based on the data you download.
