## Abstract

## Data, Domains, and Metaphors

We will understand the idea of data and types of variables in data. These will lead us to creating different kinds of graphs based on variable type, using R. We will look at diverse domains, such as Geography, Networks and Education and plot geometric visuals based on the data we find in these domains. This will help us not only appreciate the data but give us a view of the underlying realities and ideas in each of these domains. 

Using R in **RStudio** as an *Integrated Development Environment* is a crucial part of this journey. As is the paradigm of **tidy data** and the **tidyverse** method of programming in R. 


## Textbooks

We will be drawing material from a wide variety of sources for this course; as such, there is no single, required text book <em>per se</em>. 

Our exposition will draw upon [Robert Kabacoff's book on Data Visualization](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/), and on [Hadley Wickham and Garett Grolemund's R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This latter book is an excellent choice for a personally owned hardcopy book on R! 

We will also use material from tutorials published by prominent members of the **#rstats** community, such as those by [Thomas Lin Perdersen](https://www.data-imaginist.com) (author of the **tidygraph** package) for Networks; [Martijn Tennekes](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap) ( creator of **tmap** package) for Map-making; [Daniel Kallin](https://github.com/skanaar/nomnoml) (creator of the `nomnoml` package); and [Rich Iannone](https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR) (creator of the `DiagrammeR` package ) for the Diagrams.
