## Introduction

We will get acquainted with the RMarkdown format, which allows us to mix text narrative, code, code-developed figures and items from the web in a seamless document.

Then we can try to create something in the lines of what Hans Rosling did. 

Something that can:  
  - provide a visualization  
  - provide insight  
  - tell a story  
  - is reproducible
