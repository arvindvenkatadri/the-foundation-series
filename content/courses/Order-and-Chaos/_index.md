## Program overview

This century was named by Stephen Hawking as the [Age of Complexity](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/stephen-hawkings-advice-for-twenty-first-century-grads-embrace-complexity/). 

> A few years ago, Hawking was asked what he thought of the common opinion that the twentieth century was that of biology and the twenty-first century would be that of physics. Hawking replied that in his opinion the twenty-first century would be the "century of complexity". That remark probably holds more useful advice for contemporary students than they realize since it points to at least two skills which are going to be essential for new college grads in the age of complexity: statistics and data visualization.

In this course, we will look at some of the manifestations of Complexity and see how these phenomena can be understood as a model for our lives. Further, we will see how these models can be used as a tool in Art and Design.
