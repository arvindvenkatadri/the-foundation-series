## Introduction

This is a {{<hl>}} Contextual Enquiry Course{{</hl>}} in the Foundation ( freshman) year of a Bachelor's Degree in Art and Design, at the Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, Bangalore, India.

## Course Contents

-   Fundamentals of {{<hl>}}Flow and Play{{</hl>}} as defined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
-   {{<hl>}}The Six Thinking Hats Method{{</hl>}} and how to apply them in practice
-   Gain experience with the {{<hl>}}TRIZ{{</hl>}} philosophy and techniques such as the {{<hl>}}Contradiction Matrix{{</hl>}} and {{<hl>}}40 Inventive Principles{{</hl>}}

## Abstract

This Unit takes students on a journey of understanding the process of Personal Creativity and Structured Innovation.

We begin by using the idea of Flow, as a pathway between ever-increasing (creative) Complexity and Boredom as defined by Csikszentmihalyi. Childhood Games will be examined to understand the aspects of Play and linked to and the idea of "Infinite Games" by James Carse and how Rule Breaking in Play is an important step in enhancing personal creativity.

Bourdieu's concept of Cultural Capital will be interpreted as one of the primary sources for an individual's ideas, along with Csikzentmihalyi's idea of the Creative Domain, Field and the Creative Individual. Tools for enhancing Cultural Capital will be introduced. The MBTI / Big 5 Tool will be used to understanding ourselves, our abilities, strengths, traits and differences from others.

Structured heuristic techniques based on de Bono's 6 Hat method will help us see how to perform Situational Analysis and Idea Generation, to help us take ideas from conception to execution. Reference will be made to Alex Osborn's "Applied Imagination" methods and tied to the Big 5 results.

Aspects of the Russian system of innovation and problem solving, TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskhikh Zadatch) invented by Genrikh Altshuller will be introduced. Alshuller's idea of Generalized Problem Solving by borrowing ideas/memes from other Domains, his 8 Laws of Evolution of Products, and ( a few of ) the 40 Inventive Principles derived from his analysis of patents, will be covered in gamified fashion. These will be linked to with David Perkin's (Harvard Project Zero) ideas and Edward de Bono's methods to interpret, and design for, existing situations and products.

Field visits to product and logistics companies will be used to bolster and demonstrate the unity of these concepts acquired in class. Technological assignments, and non-tech making and presenting tasks will also be used in class to create gamified experiences for all of these.

The students will finally use the methods and ideas they have learnt and apply them in creating a project, artifact or performance of their own.
