<p>What do you think of immediately when you see the first picture on this page?</p>
<div id="some-everyday-objects-for-us-to-contemplate" class="section level1">
<h1>Some Everyday Objects for us to Contemplate</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><div class="figure">
<img src="pizza.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Pizza Box</p>
</div></li>
<li><div class="figure">
<img src="wrench.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Wrench</p>
</div></li>
<li><div class="figure">
<img src="chain.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cycle Chain</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<p>Let us make a list for each Object:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the Object meant to do? What is its main Purpose?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the other Accompanying Objects that it works with?</p></li>
<li><p>What is One Parameter or Knob for each of the Objects that you have listed?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the current Settings for each Knob?</p></li>
<li><p>Change the Setting of Each Knob to its natural opposite extreme. What Happens?</p></li>
<li><p>You will see that in many cases, each Knob creates a Certain Outcome at one Setting and another Outcome at the Opposite Setting.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the Source of your Contradiction !!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What sort of Contradictions do we see in these familiar objects? What is good and what is not so good? Could that be the source of a problem to solve?</p>
<p>In TRIZ, the fundamental way of looking at an Inventive Design Problem is to discover and propose <strong>Contradictions</strong>. These are rendered in as <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>stark</strong> a language as possible…the starker the better!</p>
<p>Once we have our Contradiction (and there can be more than one in a given Design Situation !) we can use TRIZ Principles to solve them <strong>WITHOUT COMPROMISE</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>TRIZ</strong>, this was of expressing a <em>Problem</em> as a simple <em>Contradiction</em> is referred to as stating an <strong>ADMINSTRATIVE CONTRADICTION (AC).</strong> (Oh those Russians…).</p>
<p>Later we will use our experience with making metaphors to convert the AC into a more TRIZ-like Contradiction, using <em>TRIZ language</em>.</p>
<p>Let us now consider some examples first and then get some practice at setting up simple <em>AC</em>:</p>

<h1>Some Example Contradictions…</h1>
<p>We see them everywhere….if one is observant!! Let’s see a few:</p>

<p>How is this for a Contradiction? A shelf in a supermarket carries this placard for a shelf of <strong><em>FRESH JUICE</em></strong>:</p>

Snails want to stay safe, and there is safety on the ground, but the ground is too hot. On the Ground, a Snail can be by itself, above the ground, they need to group together

<p>Most people’s healthcare is tied to their job….Therefore, every corona-time layoff creates yet another person without health insurance in this country. (<em>The Corona Pandemic needs healthcare and therefore health Insurance.</em>)</p>

<p>This outbreak is highlighting, with extreme clarity, every major <strong><em>contradiction</em></strong> of this society and its decaying social order. <a href="https://t.co/EtSUY3pPMi" class="uri">https://t.co/EtSUY3pPMi</a></p>
