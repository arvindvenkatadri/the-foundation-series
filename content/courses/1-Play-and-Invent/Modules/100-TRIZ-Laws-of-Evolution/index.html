<h2>Laws of Product Evolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Law of completeness of the system: Systems derive from synthesis of separate parts into a functional system.</li>
<li>Law of energy transfer in the system: Shaft, gears, magnetic fields, charged particles, which are the heart of many inventive problems.</li>
<li>Law of increasing ideality: Function is created with minimum complexity, which can be considered a ratio of system usefulness to its harmful effects. The ideal system has the desired outputs with no harmful effects, i.e., no machine, just the function(s).</li>
<li>Law of harmonization: Transferring energy more efficiently.</li>
<li>Law of uneven development of parts: Not all parts evolve at the same pace. The least will limit the overall system</li>
<li>Law of transition to a super system: Solution system becomes subsystem of larger system.</li>
<li>Law of Transition from Macro to Micro: Using physically smaller solutions, e.g., electronic tubes to chips.</li>
<li>Law of Increasing Substance-Field Involvement: Viewing and modeling systems as composed of two substances interacting through a field.</li>
</ul>
