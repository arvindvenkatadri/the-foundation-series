## Introduction

We will briefly study the Big5/MBTI Personality Test Matrix and understand the "dichotomies" these embody. We will then use these to understand ourselves, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.

## Icebreaker Game!

Look at the slide full of numbers on the screen. I would like you to:  

- *Silently* work through the slide until you have found all the numbers   
- Raise your hand when you have done so. 


## A Personality Game

I have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:  

- Discuss how to complete the Task  
- Complete the Task and document your work  
- *Also* document the main aspects of Discussion in your group. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.   
- Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team

## Why does this Matter to Us

From the two exercises, we see that:  
- reality really matters upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view.  
- We all have our "default modes" for behaviour  
- As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better.
