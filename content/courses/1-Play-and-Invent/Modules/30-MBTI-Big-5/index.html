<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We will briefly study the Big5/MBTI Personality Test Matrix and understand the “dichotomies” these embody. We will then use these to understand ourselves, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.</p>
</div>
<div id="icebreaker-game" class="section level2">
<h2>Icebreaker Game!</h2>
<p>Look at the slide full of numbers on the screen. I would like you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Silently</em> work through the slide until you have found all the numbers<br />
</li>
<li>Raise your hand when you have done so.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="a-personality-game" class="section level2">
<h2>A Personality Game</h2>
<p>I have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss how to complete the Task<br />
</li>
<li>Complete the Task and document your work<br />
</li>
<li><em>Also</em> document the main aspects of Discussion in your group. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.<br />
</li>
<li>Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why does this Matter to Us</h2>
<p>From the two exercises, we see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reality depends upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view. Note that this is about our <em>cognitive bias</em> that may depend upon our cultural outlook, and our ability to miss things. It is emphatically not about <u><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/alternative-facts/">alternative facts</a></u> which is arrant nonsense.</li>
<li>We all have our “default modes” for behaviour, that give us a restricted appreciation of the World</li>
<li>As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better.</li>
<li>Comprehending reality better gives a stronger basis for Art/Design <strong>decisions</strong> and plans for action.</li>
</ul>
