<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We will briefly study the Big5/MBTI Personality Test Matrix and understand the “dichotomies” these embody. We will then use these to understand ourselves, as we create some novel situations for ourselves in a Game.</p>
</div>
<div id="icebreaker" class="section level2">
<h2>Icebreaker!</h2>
<p>Look at the slide full of numbers on the screen. I would like you to:
- <em>Silently</em> work through the slide until you have found all the numbers
- Raise your hand when you have done so.</p>

<div id="a-personality-game" class="section level2">
<h2>A Personality Game</h2>
<p>I have divided you up into 4 groups. Each group will be given a specific task. You will need to:
- Discuss how to complete the Task
- Complete the Task and document your work
- <em>Also</em> document the main aspects of Discussion in your group. Who said/ suggested what; what were the points of agreement; what were the contentious points etc.
- Present all of this : 7 + 5 minutes / team</p>

<h2>Why does this Matter to Us</h2>
<p>From the two exercises, we see that:<br />
- reality really matters upon the viewer: and that there are many possible points of view.<br />
- We all have our “default modes” for behaviour<br />
- As creators we need to be able straddle, if possible, the spectrum of the 4 preference pairs, in order to comprehend reality better.</p>
