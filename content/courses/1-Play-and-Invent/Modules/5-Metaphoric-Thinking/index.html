<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Year of Magical Thinking is Joan Didion’s account of the year following the death of her husband, writer John Gregory Dunne, and her attempts to make sense of her grief while tending to the severe illness of her adopted daughter, Quintana. As she tries to make sense of John’s death and her own changed identity, Didion discovers that grief is not what she expected it to be. Consumed by memories of the years they lived in Los Angeles, shortly after they married and adopted Quintana, Didion feels that she has entered a state of temporary insanity. Though cool and collected on the surface, she begins to believe that her wishes might have the power to bring John back. To this end, she refuses to give away his clothes and shoes, believing that her husband will need them when he returns to her. She calls this childlike belief that her thoughts and wishes can alter reality “magical thinking.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course we are not embarked on anything like this, but we do want to generate some “magic” in our thoughts! So taking some inspiration from her “childlike belief” that can “alter reality”, let us hark back to our childhoods and see what we can do with these objects below:</p>

<h2>Activity-1: Some Objects to Contemplate</h2>
<p>How many different uses can you imagine for each of these objects? Can you briefly describe and quickly sketch a few ideas?</p>

<h2>Activity-2: Some Shapes to Contemplate</h2>
<p>Where do you reckon you can “see” these shapes ? Can you briefly describe and quickly sketch a few ideas?</p>

<div id="scoring-your-ideas" class="section level3">
<h3>Scoring your Ideas</h3>
<p>Scoring is comprised of four components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluency</strong> - total. Just add up all the responses. In this example it is 6.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - or different categories of ideas or, as Csikszentmihalyi would have us say, <em>DOMAINS</em>. Is your brick a Toy? Can it be used as…a Horticultural support thing? That is two domains, so two points.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Elaboration</strong> - amount of detail (for Example: “in a bonsai” = 0, whereas “in a bonsai to create a root-over-rock structure as an island” = 2 (one for root-over-rock, two for further detail about the island structure).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Originality</strong> - each response it compared to the total amount of responses from all of the people you gave the test to. Responses that were given by only 5% of your group are unusual (1 point), responses that were given by only 1% of your group are unique - 2 points). Total all the points. Higher scores indicate creativity*</li>
</ul>
<p>*You might have noticed that the higher fluency the higher the originality (if you did “good for you!”) This is a contamination problem and can be corrected by using a corrective calculation for originality (originality = originality/fluency).</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Both these activities are examples of exercises in <em>divergent thinking</em>. See the references for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you use the words “as” and “like” to describe your ideas?<br />
</li>
<li>Did you <em>not</em> use these words to describe your ideas?<br />
</li>
<li>Were there, in your opinion, any <em>outrageous</em> ideas presented? Why were they outrageous?</li>
<li>Are metaphors more interesting when they are surprising?</li>
<li>How did the <em>attributes</em> of the objects ( shape , texture, size, weight, orientation…) get embedded in the ideas presented?<br />
</li>
<li>Were these “embeddings” meaningful? How and why so? (Ask Bourdieu !!)</li>
</ul>
