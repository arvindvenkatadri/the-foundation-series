<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Often times we swiftly come to conclusions or decisions, without being aware that a) we are making a big mistake based on the information that is available , b) we are looking for our fondest beliefs to be true, or worse c) we are being manipulated !!</p>
<p>Hence, one of the important points of view we need to retain is to be aware of our Cognitive Biases.
