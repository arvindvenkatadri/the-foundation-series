<p>Let us take our first step into the world of TRIZ. What did you think of immediately when you saw the first picture on this page?</p>
<p>In TRIZ, the fundamental way of looking at an Inventive Design Problem is to discover and propose <strong>Contradictions</strong>. These are rendered in as <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>stark</strong> a language as possible…the starker the better!</p>
<p>Once we have our Contradiction (and there can be <em>more than one</em> in a given Design Situation !) we can use TRIZ Principles to solve them <strong>WITHOUT COMPROMISE.</strong></p>
<p>What sort of Contradictions do we see in these familiar objects? What is good and what is not so good? Could that be the source of a problem to solve?</p>
<div id="some-everyday-objects-for-us-to-contemplate" class="section level1">
<h1>Some Everyday Objects for us to Contemplate</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><div class="float">
<img src="pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza Box" />
<div class="figcaption">Pizza Box</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="float">
<img src="wrench.jpg" alt="Wrench" />
<div class="figcaption">Wrench</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="float">
<img src="chain.jpg" alt="Cycle Chain" />
<div class="figcaption">Cycle Chain</div>
</div></li>
</ol>
<p>Contemplate and note down for each Object:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the Object meant to do? What is its <em>Main Purpose</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the other <em>Accompanying Objects</em> that it works with?</p></li>
<li><p>What is <em>One Aspect, or Parameter, or Knob</em> for each of the Objects that you have listed, that makes the Object useful?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the current <em>Settings/Values for each Knob</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>Change the <em>Setting of Each Knob</em> to its natural opposite extreme. What Happens? Is it a good thing? When?</p></li>
<li><p>You will see that in many cases, each Knob creates a Certain <em>Outcome</em> at one Setting and another <em>Outcome</em> at the Opposite Setting.</p></li>
<li><p>Are both Outcomes desirable? Do you want “eat your cake and have it too?”</p></li>
<li><p>This could be the source of your <strong>PROBLEM / CONTRADICTION</strong> !!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>TRIZ</strong>, this way of expressing a <em>Problem</em> as a simple <em>Contradiction</em> is referred to as stating an <strong>ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRADICTION (AC).</strong> (Oh those Russians…).</p>
<p>Later we will use our experience with making metaphors to convert the AC into a more TRIZ-like Contradiction, using <em>TRIZ language</em>.</p>
<p>Let us now consider some examples first and then get some practice at setting up simple <em>AC</em>:</p>

<div id="some-example-contradictions" class="section level1">
<h1>Some Example Contradictions…</h1>
<p>We see them everywhere….if one is observant!! Let’s see a few:</p>

<h3>C1: Contradiction-1</h3>
<p>How is this for a Contradiction? A shelf in a supermarket carries this placard for a shelf of <strong><em>FRESH JUICE</em></strong>:</p>

<p>Snails want to stay safe, and there is safety on the ground, but the ground is too hot. On the Ground, a Snail can be by itself, above the ground, they become visible to predators.</p>

<p>So…they need to group together.</p>

<p>Most people’s healthcare is tied to their job….Therefore, every corona-time layoff creates yet another person without health insurance in this country. (<em>The Corona Pandemic needs healthcare and therefore health Insurance.</em>)</p>

<div id="contradictory-situations" class="section level2">
<h2>Contradictory Situations</h2>
<p>We don’t contemplate only <em>objects</em> at all times; indeed, as designers/artists/creators, we want to be able to <strong>make</strong> objects. What we more commonly contemplate is a <strong>situation</strong>.</p>
<p>How does one figure Parameters/Aspects/Knobs on situations?</p>
<p>We use what is called an <strong>Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram</strong>. There are many versions of this diagram depending upon the <strong>DOMAIN</strong> it is applied in; it should be considered more as a process for thinking. You should search for other forms of this diagram and quickly learn to apply them.</p>
<p><img src="IshikawaDiagram.png" width="1638" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Deciding which are the Knobs that matter, and how they effect the outcome is not always this simple. It would typically involve research using <strong>structured experimentation</strong> to determine the effects of turning the knobs and deciding which ones matter. This experimentation lies within a DOMAIN called <a href=""><strong>Design of Experiments</strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="documenting-the-administrative-contradiction" class="section level2">
<h2>Documenting the Administrative Contradiction</h2>
<p>You can document your analysis of the <em>Situation</em> using the following questionnaire <strong>5W+H</strong> format:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>What</strong> does the problem seem to be?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Who</strong> has the problem?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(Think Knobs!!)</strong></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>When</strong> does the problem occur? All the time? Under certain circumstances?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Where</strong> does the problem occur?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why</strong> does the problem occur? (“Ask why 5 times” – W. Edwards Deming)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How</strong> does the problem occur?</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This process should remind you of our exercise on the Guilford and Wallach-Kogan Divergent Thinking Game, except that this is of course more structured method, whereas that was simple brainstorming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this method you should be able to state an <em>Administrative Contradiction</em> in the following (loose!) sentence structure — Items in <code>&lt; &gt;</code> come from the Ishikawa and your 5W + H questions):</p>
<p><code>When we, as &lt; WHO / MANPOWER &gt;, attempt to perform &lt; HOW / METHOD &gt; during &lt;WHEN&gt; on &lt; WHERE / MACHINERY / KNOB&gt;, we improve &lt;EFFECT&gt;, but lose out on &lt;negative EFFECT&gt;.</code></p>
<p>Let’s see this method in action. The area of work may not be ours, but the context should be clear enough!</p>
