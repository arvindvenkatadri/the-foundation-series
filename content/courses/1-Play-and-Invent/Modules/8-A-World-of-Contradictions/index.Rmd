## Contradictory Objects

Now that we know how problems can be stated as simple *Administrative Contradictions (AC)*, we need to take the next step and make what TRIZ calls **Technical Contradictions(TC)** and **Physical Contradictions(PC)**

Recall that you considered several familiar objects in the earlier module on Problems and Contradictions.

![Pizza Box](pizza.jpg)
![ Wrench](wrench.jpg)
![Cycle Chain](chain.jpg)

- What is One Aspect/Parameter or Knob for each of the Objects that you have listed?
  
- What are the current Settings for each Knob? High/Low; Soft/Hard; Thin/Thick...
  
- Change the Setting of Each Knob to its natural opposite extreme. What happens?
  
- You will see that in many cases, each Knob creates a Certain Outcome at one Setting and another Outcome at the Opposite Setting. 
  
- Are **both** of these Outcomes desirable? Then, this is one Source of your Contradiction !!

- If not, continue with other Knobs that the Object may possess.
  

## Contradictory Situations

We don't contemplate only *objects* at all times; indeed, as designers/artists/creators, we want to be able to **make** objects. What we more commonly contemplate is a **situation**.

How does one figure Parameters/Aspects/Knobs on situations?

We use what is called an **Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram**. There are many versions of this diagram depending upon the **DOMAIN** it is applied in; it should be considered more as a process for thinking. You should search for other forms of this diagram and quickly learn to apply them. 

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4,3)}
knitr::include_graphics("IshikawaDiagram.png")

```

This diagram gives us a few prompts on Aspects/Parameters/Knobs to consider. Let us apply these to the situations below and see how to get familiar with this tool.
