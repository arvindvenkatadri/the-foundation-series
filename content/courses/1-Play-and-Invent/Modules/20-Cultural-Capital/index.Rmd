## Introduction

We will understand Pierre Bourdieu's Concept of {{<hl>}}Cultural Capital(CC){{</hl>}}. 

CC affects our view of the world and helps us identify Problem Situations and Contradictions in Life. These can then become subject to analysis using techniques such as Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hats and Genrikh Altshuller's TRIZ.

## Genes and ...

Dawkins 1989, * The Selfish Gene*, p. 192 

> "We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. 'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to **meme**. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to 'memory', or to the French word mÃªme. It should be pronounced to rhyme with 'cream'."(italics and emphasis mine)


## Activities

1. Sharing of CC: we will each of us take turns to reveal some aspect of Cultural Capital that we directly possess: **Objectified**, **Institutional**, and **Embodied**

1. You will be divided into Teams. Each Team needs to chose a wellknown parlour/household game from your childhood. Set it up and play it. 
Then, you will be given a piece of Electronic Hardware called a **Makey-Makey**. You will need to include this hardware in your Game and extend the Game in a certain way.


## Assignment:

1. Making a Street Intersection Logo: [(Inspiration)](https://www.cartogrammar.com/blog/maps-make-the-best-logos/). <br> <br>
Here are some instructions:
 - Visit your home town on Google Maps
 - Select a specific STREET INTERSECTION there.
 - Copy paste the Shape of the Street Intersection into your favourite image making software
 - Create A LOGO for your city, using the Shape, such that you show off some interesting aspects of your City, based on your own CULTURAL CAPITAL.
 - Three sentences to describe your Logo. Need I say it should be a "meme"?
 - See examples at the link above for inspiration
