## Materials

A. **Divergent Thinking**

1. Guilford Test for Divergent Thinking: [(Weblink)](https://curtbonk.com/bobweb/d1.html)

2. Wallas-Kogan Test for Divergent Thinking: [(Weblink)](https://curtbonk.com/bobweb/d2.html)

### Scoring

Scoring is comprised of four components:

Originality - each response it compared to the total amount of responses from all of the people you gave the test to.  Reponses that were given by only 5% of your group are unusual (1 point), responses that were given by only 1% of your group are unique - 2 points).  Total all the point.  Higher scores indicate creativity*
Fluency - total. Just add up all the responses.  In this example it is 6.
Flexibility - or different categories.  In this case there are five different categories (weapon and hit sister are from the same general idea of weapon)
Elaboration - amount of detail (for Example "a doorstop" = 0 whereas "a door stop to prevent a door slamming shut in a strong wind" = 2 (one for explanation of door slamming, two for further detail about the wind).

*You might have noticed that the higher fluency the higher the originality (if you did "good for you!")  This is a contamination problem and can be corrected by using a corrective calculation for originality
(originality = originality/fluency).
