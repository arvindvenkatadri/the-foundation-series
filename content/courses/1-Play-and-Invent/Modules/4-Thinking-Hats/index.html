<div id="scoring" class="section level3">
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>Scoring is comprised of four components:</p>
<p>Originality - each response it compared to the total amount of responses from all of the people you gave the test to. Reponses that were given by only 5% of your group are unusual (1 point), responses that were given by only 1% of your group are unique - 2 points). Total all the point. Higher scores indicate creativity*
Fluency - total. Just add up all the responses. In this example it is 6.
Flexibility - or different categories. In this case there are five different categories (weapon and hit sister are from the same general idea of weapon)
Elaboration - amount of detail (for Example “a doorstop” = 0 whereas “a door stop to prevent a door slamming shut in a strong wind” = 2 (one for explanation of door slamming, two for further detail about the wind).</p>
<p>*You might have noticed that the higher fluency the higher the originality (if you did “good for you!”) This is a contamination problem and can be corrected by using a corrective calculation for originality
(originality = originality/fluency).</p>
