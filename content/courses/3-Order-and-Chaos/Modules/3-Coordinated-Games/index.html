<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So, would you wear a veshti/kurta/angavastram, or silk paavade to college?</p>
<p>When you want someone to <em>search the internet</em>, what do you tell them
do?</p>
<p>How do you show someone that you agree with what they are doing at
that moment? Even if you don’t know them?</p>
<p>How do you know where the exit is in a public place?</p>
<p>Where would you stage a protest? How would you get other people to join in?</p>
<p>What does “less than three” mean?!!??</p>
<p>In the module on <a href="">Game Theory</a>, we saw how we all are engaged in <em>adversarial and transactional Games</em> with many other people, most of
whom are strangers to us <a href="">The Prisoner’s Dilemma</a>. But as remarked before, the Human Species is perhaps unique in that we are able to <u><a href="https://fee.org/media/4316/547_42.pdf">cooperate with strangers</a></u>!! So we are not always adversaries or enemies, and we are able to obtain <strong><em>unspoken agreement and correspondence with strangers</em></strong>.</p>
<p>What use would this be? Would it be a Design Tool? How?</p>
<p>Today, we will study <strong>Coordination Games</strong> and <strong>Schelling Focus Points</strong>, and see how these concepts can help better businesses.</p>
