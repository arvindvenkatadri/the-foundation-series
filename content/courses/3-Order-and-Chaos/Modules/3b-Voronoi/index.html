<h2>A Model for Proximity: The Voronoi and the Delaunay Diagrams</h2>
<p>So how do we model “proximity”?</p>

<h3>Plotting the Voronoi Diagram</h3>
<p>How do we plot this diagram?</p>
<p>We will use this tool: <u><a href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic"><strong>Geogebra</strong></a></u></p>
<p>Download and install this on your laptops. You can also use it in your browser <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en" class="uri">https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en</a> and download the <em>.ggb</em> files that you create.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Exercise 1: Let us first see <u><a href="/pdf/Proximity/SohoMap.ggb"><strong>Soho with the Voronoi Diagram</strong></a></u></li>
</ol>
<p>Now let us make such a diagram step by step:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Exercise 2: Let us try with just three points and see what we need to do to plot the Voronoi Diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Exercise 3: With 4 points: <u><a href="/pdf/Proximity/four%20points.ggb">Four Pointer Voronoi</a></u></p></li>
<li><p>Exercise 4: Let us now add more points. How do we make a multi-point Voronoi? We need to make a <u><a href="/pdf/Proximity/VoronoiLargeNoOfPointsInGeogebra.pdf"><strong>“list of points” in Geogebra</strong></a></u></p></li>

<h2>Fun Stuff with Geogebra and Voronoi</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Predator Prey Movement….</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Create a set of points in Geogebra.</li>
<li>Colour/Shape one of the outermost points as a predator which circles the herd.</li>
<li>Use the Voronoi diagram to model the <em>Zone of Danger</em> for each of the animals in the inner herd.</li>
<li>Try <strong>Animation</strong> in Geogebra !!</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Service Areas with Voronoi</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Import a 5km * 5km square of area in your home town, from Google Maps, into Geogebra.</li>
<li>Locate points of interest, all in one category ( ATMs, Post Offices, Hospitals, Police Stations…)</li>
<li>Plot the Voronoi Diagram to show the area served by each such institution.</li>
<li>Calculate the area in Geogebra.</li>
<li>Assume a flat population/sqkm and use that to calculate the number of people served by each.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All</strong> of this can be done without leaving Geogebra !!</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Voronoi Portraits and Facial Recognition</li>
</ol>
<p>A. I am Predator</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a picture of yourself and import it into Geogebra</li>
<li>Plot Points on the Portrait such that the main facial features are defined.</li>
<li>Use a Delaunay Triagulation of these points to create a Portrait.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="AVinMath.jpeg" /></p>
<p>B. My Face is My Fortune</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the same for a famous person, past or present.</li>
<li>Run a small survey in the class to see how many people can recognize celebrity!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Distances?</h2>
<p>We have used the simplest and most common of geometric distances between entities, the <strong>Euclidean Distance </strong> to model proximity. Are there other <em>measures of distance</em>?</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you measure distance between <em>digital words</em>? For example <span class="math inline">\(10010011\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(11011011\)</span>?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Hamming distance</strong> between two equal-length strings of symbols is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. The symbols may be letters, bits, or decimal digits, among other possibilities. For example, the Hamming distance between:
“karolin” and “kathrin” is 3.
“karolin” and “kerstin” is 3.
“kathrin” and “kerstin” is 4.
0000 and 1111 is 4.
2173896 and 2233796 is 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>How would you measure distance over a <em>curved surface</em> such as the earth?</li>

<p>We will use the Euclidean and maybe other concepts of distance when we get into our Machine Learning models!</p>
