### Seeing Data

Let us first examine the street traffic data we have gathered for any "model-like" pattern!

We will use a tool called, umm....**WTFcsv**. Let us first quickly see what this tool offers us!

  <br>
  `r blogdown::shortcode("vimeo", "150216437")` 
  <br>
  

Let us import our data into the **WTFcsv** tool [(**Web Link**)](https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/) and see what patterns lurk beneath our data!


### Is Randomness a Design Tool?

1. Do you remember plucking mangoes from the trees in your childhood gardens? Did you happen to be the youngest in the group? Did you have run home to get the salt + chilly powder? 
Why did you trust your friends? ;-D

2. Let us throw some chalk pieces on the floor at random and see what happens!!





### Words belong Hamlet

Let us read the famous nunnery scene from **Hamlet**:

a)  Hamlet in 4 Minutes:\
    <br> `r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "EmjWIMMtjDc")` <br>

b)  *To be or Not to be*: [(Web Link)](http://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be/)

What was Hamlet's problem? How did he solve that problem?

### Suppose we were Hamlet....

What would we want to know?

Who is our friend? What is the chance that we will survive? 

We would need to conduct an "Experiment", rather like Hamlet did, without quite going or feigning madness of course. But there is a **Madness to the Method**, as we will see...

!["Design of Experiments - A Workflow: A Madness in the Method"](http://www.statsref.com/HTML/ppdac.png)

From [StatsRef](http://www.statsref.com/HTML/?statistics__statistical_analys.html) : 

>The PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem definition through to conclusions — this is typically not the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a series of feedback loops. A summary of a revised PPDAC approach is shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise sequence (1→5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often will feed back to the previous stage. 
In addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the reverse direction, starting with Problem definition and then examining expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions (without pre-judging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues, step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e→a) determining the implications of these expectations for each stage of the process.



### Design of Experiments

Let us pretend we are Hamlet and design a simple experiment to find out some "truth" ( highly probable idea) that is important to us.

For example: Let us consider the **Short Term Memory** of Foundation Students: 

- is it different between those who pursue "*Art-related*" degrees and those who pursue "*Design-related*" degrees? 
- Between Male and Female students? Any other factors?

We will choose one of these questions, or a similar one, and use the **PPDAC Method** to proceed with our Experiment. This paper by Lawrence to guide our Hypothesis Testing and the Design of our Experiment: 

- **Lawrence - A Design of Experiments Workshop as an Introduction to Statistics** [(**Weblink to PDF**)](Lawrence - A Design of Experiments Workshop as an Introduction to Statistics.pdf)

This is the paper describing a simple *Design of Experiments* workshop in class much like ours. We will try to mimic as much of this as we can. Do read through this in the evening today in preparation for our experiment.



### Making a Data Comic out of our Experiment

What have been our Conclusions with the Experiment? Let us take our Experiment and make a comic out of it:
