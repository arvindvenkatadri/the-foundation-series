## Introduction

Do you think your friends have more friends than you have? Do you think that you are **outside the herd**, and that what you think or do is from your own mind?

Anyways...

## Activities

### Activity: Secret Santa Game

Let us play this in the vanilla way: Paper chits with names in a bin and drawing them in turn. What can go wrong with this? Ask Avni Gupta.

Should we use this instead? <u><https://www.drawnames.com.sg/secret-santa-generator></u>

Discussion: `Nodes, Links, Link Directionality, Connected and Disconnected Networks`

### Activity: Barabasi Cocktail Party Game

This is a game "invented" by Alberto-Laszlo Barabasi, a Network Science pioneer and expert, who has written a wonderful, and wonderfully acessible, book on Network Science, available online <u><http://networksciencebook.com/></u>

1.  Please take a coin in your hand. (A rupee coin is good!)
2.  Find a ~~stranger~~ potential new friend in the classroom. Both of you toss your coins.
3.  If the coins show two Heads or two Tails, introduce yourselves, make small talk, exchange classroom and college gossip. 2 Minutes!
4.  Make a note of your new friends initials.
5.  We will plot this conversation on the board. How?

`r blogdown::shortcode("vimeo", "191074419")`

Discussion: `Network Mechanisms, Information Flow, Giant Component, Emergence`

### Activity: Indian Surnames Game

1.  How many common Indian surnames do we know? Let us write them on the board.
2.  Each of us will now look at each surname and recollect how many people they know with that surname.
3.  Write down the score for each surname.
4.  Let's plot this on (yet another) network!!

Discussion: `Node Degree, Giant Component?  Small Worlds?  Multi-Link network, Link Values or Costs`

### Activity: Hi, I am Kevin Bacon, SMI Foundation 2023 Batch

Let us find a Keven Bacon in SMI Foundation Studies Programme!! Six Degrees of Separation...or of Kevin Bacon?

Look at this video before you proceed!

`r blogdown::shortcode("vimeo", "14196818")`

1.  Collect friends Data from across college/class, import and plot, analyze and comment
2.  Use this online tool at DataBasic.io <u><https://databasic.io></u> to *Connect the Dots*, OR
3.  Even more fun at at GraphCommons <u><https://graphcommons.com/graphs/new></u>

Discussion: `Node Degree, Centrality, Betweenness, Link Values or Costs`

### Activity: Can you Introduce me to Chandler, again?

1.  Take your favourite Literary Work / TV Serial / Movie and create a Network Database for it.

2.  How? Use conversations between pairs of individuals (`nodes`) to create links. E.g. each distinct conversation is a `link`, and the number of sentences uttered is the `weight` of the link.

3.  Visualize it either with or without tech tools From Teach Engineering, this Activity Sheet <u><https://www.teachengineering.org/activities/view/uno_graphtheory_lesson01_activity2></u>.

**Hah! Engineering in a Design college!!**

3.  Can also use [Graph Comics](https://aviz.fr/~bbach/graphcomics/) <u><https://aviz.fr/~bbach/graphcomics/></u>

Discussion: `Networks are everywhere, Cannot "unsee" them, You are a node and you are a link...are you?`

### Activity: Way-Spotting Game

Now that we have an idea of `nodes`, `links` and `costs`, let us get an experience of some more network science ideas:

1.  Make groups of 3.
2.  Head over to <u><http://www.wayspotting.com/index.html></u>
3.  Play!! Make a note of your route each time ( your "traversal" of the network)
4.  Note if you can see the following:

-   Frequently Used Nodes
-   Frequently used Links

5.  See here for more info: <u>[https://medium.com/\\\@ran_katzir/teaching-network-science-using-board-games-f78489a3b3bd](https://medium.com/@ran_katzir/teaching-network-science-using-board-games-f78489a3b3bd){.uri}</u>. Sadly link seems dead ;-(

Discussion: `Network Traversal, Node Degree, Centrality, Betweenness, Link Values or Costs`

|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Kuch toh log kahenge                 | People will say something or the other         |
| Logon ka kaam hai kehna              | It's the job of people to say something        |
| Chhodo bekaar ki baaton mein         | Forget all these useless things                |
| Kahin beet na jaaye raina            | Or else our night will end just around them    |
| Kuch toh log kahenge                 | People will say something or the other         |
| ------                               | -------                                        |
| Kuch reet jagat ki aisi hai(2)       | Some traditions of the world are such that     |
| Har ek subah ki shaam huyi(2)        | Every morning has had an evening               |
| Tu kaun hai, tera naam hai kya       | Who are you and what's your name               |
| Sita bhi yahan badnaam huyi          | Even Goddess Sita has been defamed here        |
| Phir kyun sansaar ki baaton se       | Then why with these conversations of the world |
| Bheeg gaye tere naina                | Have your eyes become bedewed                  |
| Kuch toh log kahenge                 | People will say something or the other         |
| ----------                           | ------------                                   |
| Humko joh taane dete hai(2)          | Those who taunt us saying that                 |
| Hum khoye hai in rangraliyon mein(2) | We're lost in this debauchery                  |
| Humne unko bhi chup chupke           | Secretly I've also seen them                   |
| Aate dekha in galiyon mein           | Coming in these streets                        |
| Yeh sach hai jhoothi baat nahi       | This is the truth and not a lie                |
| Tum bolo yeh sach hai na             | You tell me, isn't this the truth?             |
| Kuch toh log kahenge                 | People will say something or the other         |
| ...                                  | ...                                            |
