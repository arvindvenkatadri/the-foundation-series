Man is an Island by John Donne</a>
:::

From <https://nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/famous/no-man-is-an-island/>

>The words ‘No man is an island’ were embedded in a deeply Christian sermon about how human beings are connected to each other, and how important that connection is for the wellbeing and survival of any individual. When you hear the church bell tolling for someone who has died, don’t ask who it is, Donne says, just know that it’s tolling for you too because you are part of the same society and the death of anyone takes a part of your own life away.

Does the Bell toll for thee?
