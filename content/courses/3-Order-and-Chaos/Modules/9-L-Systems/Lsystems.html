<p>Trees are fractal in nature, meaning that patterns created by the large structures, such as the main branches, repeat themselves in smaller structures, such as smaller branches…. a universal growth pattern first observed by Leonardo da Vinci 500 years ago: a simple yet startling relationship that always holds between the size of a tree’s trunk and sizes of its branches.</p>

<p>Let us see how we can create <strong>“Algorithmic Trees”</strong>.</p>

1) Marcia Ascher: The Kolam Tradition</p>
<p>This is a very readable intro to Kolam, the threshold art form from Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>Marcia Ascher has written two great books on the subject of math + culture.
(I will put up her books, “Ethnomathematics” and “Math Elsewhere” on a separate folder on BB.)</p>

<li>Saty Raghavachary: Tile-based Kolam Patterns</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an alternative way, of using permutations of simple “Tiles” that can be used to alphabetically form a Kolam. ( This is also briefly touched upon in MArcia Ascher’s paper).</p>
<p>Saty Raghavachary is Professor of Computer Science at U of Southern California.</p>
<p>Also take a look a the 2 minute video on kolam at his website: <a href="https://satysfactory.blogspot.in/2009/01/kolams.html" class="uri">https://satysfactory.blogspot.in/2009/01/kolams.html</a></p>

<p>if you have heard of the word “godwottery”, it came from this poem.</p>
