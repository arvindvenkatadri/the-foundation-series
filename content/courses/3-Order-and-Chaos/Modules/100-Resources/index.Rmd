## Introduction
The course is based on large Human Experiences that can form the basis for **Model-based** Thinking.  

Each of the following Section Titles is an **Abstract Noun** that represents one such **Human Experience**. The understanding of each Human Experience is intended to lead to a Model, in the manner of Charlie Munger and Scott E. Page.  The Human Experience + Model will be, in each case, motivated by contemplating a well known Story, or a Drama, and a Painting. The Models may resemble a Thought Experiment, or a Diagram, or a simple Procedure or Math Formula, or a piece of Computer Code. The Models are intended to provide directions for artistic and design endeavours.

The Models will be understood, internalized, fitted in with what we already know, and generalized to new applications. This will done with the help of activities based on games, videos, art-related activities, open source software tools, field experiments, field visits, additional readings, writings and discussions. 

## Complexity
**Other Terms:** ` Emergence /  Coherence / Aggregation / Unison / Self Organization`

- Mitchell Resnick: <u>[Beyond the Centralized Mindset](https://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/decentralized/)</u>
- Steven Johnson: "Emergence": Chapter..TBD  
- Motivate "individual, simple rules" that lead to "emergence of patterns" as a central idea  
- Motivate Philip Anderson's idea "More is Different" <u>[PDF](https://www.tkm.kit.edu/downloads/TKM1_2011_more_is_different_PWA.pdf)</u>
- Simple and not so simple Phenomena  
	-  Mexican Wave and Clapping Patterns

	-  Kannada Proverb "Gumpinalli Govinda"  
	-  Douglas Hofstadter, "Ant Fugue" in his 1979 book   
	-  Use the "Rain" video ( though that does have Central Control...). Can be set up to be an emergent exercise:  
		-  by setting up the three actions ( snapping fingers; slapping the knees; Jumping)  
		-  Rules would be to decide whether or not go to the next action in the sequence, spending 15-20 seconds in each  
		-  Imitate your nearest neighbour  
		- Can we have a spontaneous *a capella*, like a flash mob?

`Hardware: WiFi network hotspot; Smartphones; Arduino with Wifi; Makey-Makey for position location based on footfall`

**Ideas from our Course:** `Proximity; Schelling Points`

### Project 4: Friends (Season 65, Episode 12)
**Task:** Use this article in the Atlantic Magazine as inspiration: [How friendships in Adulthood ](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/how-friendships-change-over-time-in-adulthood/411466/). Create a physical graph/network related installation, based on personal, or crowd-sourced, or fictitious but plausible friendship data, and show in an interactive way how these friendship networks change over time. Use our collected college network data, and inspiration from <https://graphcommons.com> as  a starting point. Can embed electronic (lights) or computed elements ( touch ) , if desired from an aesthetic point of view or to create/enhance Viewer participation. The installation should show small changes over “time” and must be **wilfully and meaningfully degradable by viewers**. Water, ink, knives, or flame, rubber-bands and oil are possibilities. No acid.

**Tools:** `Software: None specified. graphcommons.com and RStudio are possibilities. Arduino can also be used for embedding computational elements.` 
`Hardware: None specified. NO THERMOCOL.`  

**Ideas from our Course:** `Networks and Graphs; Connectors and Hubs; Network Dynamics and Measures; Erdos-Renyi / Watts-Strogatz / Barabasi-Albert models; Power Laws`


#### Project 5: Six Degrees of Separation

**Task:** Read the Skit/Play , [“Six Degrees of Separation”](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/72632/six-degrees-of-separation-by-john-guare/) by John Guare. Stage or show in some way,  part or all of it.

**Tools:** `Software: None specified`
`Hardware: None specified. NO THERMOCOL.`

**Ideas from our Course:** `Networks and Graphs; Network Dynamics`
