## Introduction: Where are the Stones?
We saw how we could use `randomization` to generate parallel worlds to make sense of our experiment, and to decide whether there was something *algorthmic* Mother Nature was doing, or if it was just mere chance that we saw something.

Are there other applications of this *chaotic procedure*? Can we throw more random stones, some more **outrageous slings and arrows of fortune** back at the world? Let us see if there are some applications where this might be a useful thing to do!
