### Movie Time!
Let us watch a (very ) small part of this movie, [The Three Musketeers -1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_(1973_live-action_film))

 <br> `r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "Gj_DmO9jC3U")` <br>



### Fiction Time!

Let us read a bit of good old classic fiction !! This is the Conversation that occurs right before the duel scene we saw in the video above. 

[**Chapter 5. THE KING'S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL'S GUARDS**](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1257/1257-h/1257-h.htm).[^1]
\
Keep an eye on the conversation! 

And an ear open for Frenchified English, I beseech you!!

### Discussion-1

Which pill do you want? Blue, or Red?

 - Reward

### Nice Guys Finish First

 <br> `r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "rr6lsTgZKAQ")` <br>


### Discussion-2

  - Players
  - Payoffs
  - Strategies
  - Game Matrix
  
What strategies are possible as a bowler in Cricket? As a batsman? What strategies are **permitted**? By whom?


```{r, out.width = "350px",out.height = "450px", echo=FALSE}

### The Game of Trust

And finally, let us **play** a Game, the **Game of Trust** [(Website)](https://ncase.me/trust) !

### Robert Axelrod's Study on Cooperation

This is a famous study of the Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma by Robert Axelrod, **The Evolution of Cooperation**,[(PDF)](Axelrod-Hamilton.pdf)

And here is Robert Axelrod on the **RadioLab Podcast**

### Prisoners' Dilemma: A Case Study

The story of Southwest Airlines' **Early Bird Check-In**[(Weblink)](https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/03/05/southwest-airlines-boarding-and-game-theory/)


### What are the Assumptions in Game Theory?

- That gains and pains can be **quantified**
- Rationality
- Players have identical and opposed aims (Symmetry)
- In most cases, the game is **zero-sum**
- Some form of spoke/unspoken agreement as to what may and may not be done ( i.e Rules of the Game )
