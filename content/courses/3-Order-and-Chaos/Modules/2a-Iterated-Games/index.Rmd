## Introduction

### Do you know who  these four people are ?

```{r, out.width = "350px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg/512px-Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg")

### Movie Time!
Let us watch a (very ) small part of this movie, [The Three Musketeers -1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_(1973_live-action_film))

 <br> `r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "Gj_DmO9jC3U")` <br>



### Fiction Time!

Let us read a bit of good old classic fiction !! This is the Conversation that occurs right before the duel scene we saw in the video above. 

[**Chapter 5. THE KING'S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL'S GUARDS**](http://www.literaturepage.com/read/thethreemusketeers-52.html).[^1]
\
Keep an eye on the conversation! 

And an ear open for Frenchified English, I beseech you!!

### Discussion-1

Which pill do you want? Blue, or Red?

 - Reward
 - Regret aka FOMO
 - Risk
 - Retribution

### Nice Guys Finish First

 <br> `r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "rr6lsTgZKAQ")` <br>


### Discussion-2

  - Players
  - Payoffs
  - Strategies
  - Game Matrix
  
What strategies are possible as a bowler in Cricket? As a batsman? What strategies are **permitted**? By whom?


```{r, out.width = "150px",out.height = "350px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rishabh.jpg")
```


And in this game ?

```{r, out.width = "150px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("cover.jpg")
```

### Saddle Points and Nash Equilibrium


```{r echo=FALSE}

# Ray and Dotty
# J D Williams book example
z <- matrix(data = c(7,2,5,3,2,2,3,2,5,3,4,1,1,4,4,6), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
x <- 1:nrow(z)
y <- 1:ncol(z)

persp(x,y,z,phi = 15, theta = 50, ylab = "Dotty", xlab = "Ray")

```

  
### The Game of Trust

And finally, let us **play** a Game, the **Game of Trust** [(Website)](https://ncase.me/trust) !

### Robert Axelrod's Study on Cooperation

This is a famous study of the Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma by Robert Axelrod, **The Evolution of Cooperation**,[(PDF)](Axelrod-Hamilton.pdf)

### Prisoners' Dilemma: A Case Study

The story of Southwest Airlines' **Early Bird Check-In**[(Weblink)](https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/03/05/southwest-airlines-boarding-and-game-theory/)


### What are the Assumptions in Game Theory?

- That gains and pains can be **quantified**
- Rationality
- Players have identical and opposed aims (Symmetry)
- In most cases, the game is **zero-sum**
- Some form of spoke/unspoken agreement as to what may and may not be done ( i.e Rules of the Game )
