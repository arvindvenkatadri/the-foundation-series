Trees are fractal in nature, meaning that patterns created by the large structures, such as the main branches, repeat themselves in smaller structures, such as smaller branches.... a universal growth pattern first observed by Leonardo da Vinci 500 years ago: a simple yet startling relationship that always holds between the size of a tree's trunk and sizes of its branches.

Let us see how we can create **"Algorithmic Trees"**.

1) Marcia Ascher: The Kolam Tradition

This is a very readable intro to Kolam, the threshold art form from Tamil Nadu.

Marcia Ascher has written two great books on the subject of math + culture. 
(I will put up her books, "Ethnomathematics" and "Math Elsewhere" on a separate folder on BB.)


2) Saty Raghavachary: Tile-based Kolam Patterns

This is an alternative way, of using permutations of simple "Tiles" that can be used to alphabetically form a Kolam. ( This is also briefly touched upon in MArcia Ascher's paper).

Saty Raghavachary is Professor of Computer Science at U of Southern California.

Also take a look a the 2 minute video on kolam at his website: https://satysfactory.blogspot.in/2009/01/kolams.html


### Symmetry

if you have heard of the word "godwottery", it came from this poem.
