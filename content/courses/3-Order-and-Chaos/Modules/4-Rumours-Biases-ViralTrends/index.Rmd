Man is an Island by John Donne</a>
:::

From <https://nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/famous/no-man-is-an-island/>

>The words ‘No man is an island’ were embedded in a deeply Christian sermon about how human beings are connected to each other, and how important that connection is for the wellbeing and survival of any individual. When you hear the church bell tolling for someone who has died, don’t ask who it is, Donne says, just know that it’s tolling for you too because you are part of the same society and the death of anyone takes a part of your own life away.

Does the Bell toll for thee?

Hindi Lyrics | English Translation
-------------|--------------------
Kuch toh log kahenge	|People will say something or the other
Logon ka kaam hai kehna	| It's the job of people to say something
Chhodo bekaar ki baaton mein |	Forget all these useless things
Kahin beet na jaaye raina	| Or else our night will end just around them
Kuch toh log kahenge |	People will say something or the other
------ | -------
Kuch reet jagat ki aisi hai(2) |	Some traditions of the world are such that
Har ek subah ki shaam huyi(2) | Every morning has had an evening
Tu kaun hai, tera naam hai kya| Who are you and what's your name
Sita bhi yahan badnaam huyi |Even Goddess Sita has been defamed here
Phir kyun sansaar ki baaton se | Then why with these conversations of the world
Bheeg gaye tere naina | Have your eyes become bedewed
Kuch toh log kahenge | People will say something or the other
---------- | ------------
Humko joh taane dete hai(2) |	Those who taunt us saying that
Hum khoye hai in rangraliyon mein(2) |	We're lost in this debauchery
Humne unko bhi chup chupke | Secretly I've also seen them
Aate dekha in galiyon mein| Coming in these streets
Yeh sach hai jhoothi baat nahi | This is the truth and not a lie
Tum bolo yeh sach hai na | You tell me, isn't this the truth?
Kuch toh log kahenge | People will say something or the other
... | ...
