## Seeing Data

Let us first examine the street traffic data we have gathered for any
"model-like" pattern! We will use a tool called, ah..umm..ahem..
er....**WTFcsv**. Let us first quickly see what this tool offers us!

<br> `r blogdown::shortcode("vimeo", "150216437")` <br>

Let us import our data into the <u>[**WTFcsv**
tool](https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/)</u> and see what patterns lurk
beneath our data!

### Discussion-1

-   So everything random is not really random?
-   Does seeing a pattern make it "not random"?

## Is Randomness a Design Tool?

1.  Do you remember plucking mangoes from the trees in your childhood
    gardens?
2.  Did you happen to be the youngest in the group?
3.  Did you have run home to get the salt + chilly powder?
4.  Why did you trust your friends not to eat off the best mangoes in
    your absence? ;-D
5.  Were you used to being the "*denner*" in every game? Or the last
    person to bat or bowl or whatever was the cool thing in the game...
6.  Or did you do that "bat numbers" thing?
7.  Why did you trust your friends? ;-D

So can we use **Randomness** in Design? With *intent*?

And is <u>[this](https://www.jacksonpollock.org)</u> the use of **randomness** in Art?

### Pedagogical Vandalism

Let us throw some chalk pieces on the floor at random and see what
happens!!

1.  Was that a completely "mad" thing to do, throwing stuff on the
    floor? Or was it an act of *Pedagogical Vandalism*?

2.  Is Randomness just too much to handle or comprehend?

3.  Or can we "tame" it in some way, and put it to use in Art, Design,
    and Tech?

4.  Have we been doing this all along? Have we been <u>[*holding
    infinity in the palm of our
    hands*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence)</u>,
    in the हाथ कीे लकीरे?

5.  What **diagrams or thought experiments** can we create to do this?

6.  WHY would this be a good idea? Is there a very **Human Motivation**
    behind this desire we might have? 
    
7. Could this song indicate what our situation might be?

      <u><https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qan0Y9hXpPQ></u>
    
      <u><https://www.filmyquotes.com/songs/1381></u>

7.  Or let's ask <u>[this lady](https://wyldnetworks.com/blog/hedy-lamarr-frequency-hopping-spread-spectrum)</u> here.

## <u>[Wait, But Why?](https://waitbutwhy.com)</u>

-   Randomness can help create fairness?
-   Visibly?
-   *Generate Randomness* to make things fair? How?
-   What does that even mean, "generate randomness"?
-  If something is random-random, how can it be fair "every time"?
- What does <u>[**"every time"**](https://web.archive.org/web/20190302202830id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a931/ac1b3ef11235d4516f341b3b5bd8b1ee330e.pdf)</u> even mean?

We'll see.
