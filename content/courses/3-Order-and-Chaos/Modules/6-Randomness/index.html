<h2>Seeing Data</h2>
<p>Let us then examine the street traffic data we have gathered for any
‚Äúmodel-like‚Äù pattern! Is our data clean? Do we have two columns of data,
one containing 60counts of vehicles, and the other containing
inter-vehicular gap times in seconds?<br />
We will use a tool called, ah‚Ä¶umm‚Ä¶ahem‚Ä¶er‚Ä¶<strong>WTFcsv</strong>. Let us
first quickly see what this tool offers us!</p>
<p><br> {{% vimeo "150216437" %}} <br></p>
<p>Let us import our data into the <u><a href="https://databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/"><strong>WTFcsv</strong>
tool</a></u> and see what patterns lurk
beneath our data!</p>
<div id="discussion-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion-1</h3>
<ul>
<li>There were similar patterns in everybody‚Äôs data
üòÆ</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>What we saw was an example of the Poisson Arrival Process.</li>
<li>This has applications in <em>Service Design</em>, <em>Traffic Management</em>,
<em>Logistics</em>, <em>Finding Defects in Materials</em>, <em>Weather Modelling</em>‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
<p>From <u><a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/297375" class="uri">https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/297375</a></u>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Say) Lambda(<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) is the <em>average number</em> of cars that pass per
unit of time, let‚Äôs say 60/hour (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 60). We know, however,
that the actual number will vary - some days more, some days less. The
<strong>Poisson Distribution</strong> allows us to <em>model this variability</em>.</p>
<p>Now, an average of 60 cars per hour equates to an average of 1 car
passing by each minute. Again though, we know there‚Äôs going to be
variability in the amount of time between arrivals: Sometimes more
than 1 minute; other times less. The <strong>Exponential Distribution</strong>
allows us to <em>model this variability</em>.</p>
<p>All that being said, cars passing by on a road won‚Äôt always follow a
Poisson Process. If there‚Äôs a traffic signal just around the corner,
for example, arrivals are going to be bunched up instead of steady. On
an open highway, a slow tractor-trailer may hold up a long line of
cars, again causing bunching. In these cases, the Poisson Distribution
may still work okay for longer time periods, but the exponential will
fail badly in modeling arrival times.</p>
<p>Note also that there is huge variability based on <strong>time of day</strong>:
busier during commuting times; much slower at 3am. Make sure that your
lambda is reflective of the specific time period you are considering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lambda then becomes a <strong>parameter</strong> of the model. And the higher the
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the more the traffic. Hence shorter the <em>average
inter-vehicular gap time</em>, which is <span class="math inline">\(\sim \frac{1}{\lambda}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>So everything random is not really random?</li>
<li>Is <em>anything</em> random at all?</li>
<li>Does seeing a pattern make it ‚Äúnot random‚Äù?</li>
<li>Are we just Victims of Randomness and cannot do much else but put up
with it?</li>
</ul>

<div id="poisson-distribution-as-a-4as-complexity-idea" class="section level2">
<h2>Poisson Distribution as a 4As Complexity Idea‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>Consider a coin toss. One gets HEAD(H) or TAIL(T), and if the coin is fair, the long term chances of getting a H or a T are even. If one tosses a single coin several times, one gets different sequences of Hs and Ts.</p>
<p>If we assume that an H means people <u><a href="https://youtu.be/w9NbXDXvr8M"><strong>get into their car and drive</strong></a></u>, what can
we say of many many people? They are all tossing coins, so to speak, and leave only if they get a H. <em>Each sequence of Hs and Ts is a manifestation of car traffic</em>, with H being a vehicle, and T being no vehicle.</p>
<p>In a large society with <span class="math inline">\(n~ -&gt; \infty\)</span>, not many people drive out at any given time, so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is low. So the product <span class="math inline">\(people \times p(H) = np\)</span> can be thought of as a constant, say 10, or 100.</p>
<p>The Accumulated random binary Actions of a large number of people gives us an aggregate <u><a href="https://math.oxford.emory.edu/site/math117/connectingPoissonAndBinomial/"><strong>Poisson distribution</strong></a></u> for the occurrence of traffic, with a mean of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = np\)</span>.</p>

<p>But we are interested in more than just the Poisson Process. And mangoes
are far more interesting than cars!!!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do you remember plucking mangoes from the trees in your childhood
gardens?</li>
<li>Did you happen to be the youngest in the group?</li>
<li>Did you have run home to get the salt + chilly powder?</li>
<li>Why did you trust your friends not to eat off the best mangoes in
your absence? ;-D</li>
<li>Were you used to being the ‚Äú<em>denner</em>‚Äù in every game?</li>
<li>Or the last person to bat or bowl, or whatever was the cool thing in the game‚Ä¶</li>
<li>Or did you do that ‚Äúbat numbers‚Äù thing?</li>
<li>Why did you trust your friends? ;-D</li>
<li>What strategy did you use when playing ‚ÄúRock, Paper, Scissors‚Äù? Were
you always ‚Äústeady as a rock‚Äù, or ‚Äúvariable as traffic‚Äù?</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps you suffered, but maybe you didn‚Äôt because everyone ‚Äúgot their
turn‚Äù and they weren‚Äôt always the first, nor were you always the last‚Ä¶
So somehow it was all‚Ä¶fair, because it was ‚Äúrandom‚Äù.</p>
<p>And you didn‚Äôt stick with just one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors. But chose one at‚Ä¶..random.</p>
<p>So can we use <strong>Randomness</strong> in Design? With <em>intent</em>? And is <u><a href="https://www.jacksonpollock.org">this</a></u> the use of
<strong>randomness</strong> in Art?</p>

<h3>Pedagogical Vandalism</h3>
<p>Let us throw some chalk pieces on the floor at random and see what
happens!!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Was that a completely ‚Äúmad‚Äù thing to do, throwing stuff on the
floor? Or was it an act of <strong><em>Pedagogical Vandalism</em></strong>? (See
<u><a href="https://youtu.be/OCTaIZc1o8g?si=o7Bhi437vFZppXJQ"><em>wreck this
Journal</em></a></u>).</p></li>
<li><p>Is Randomness just too much to handle or comprehend?</p></li>
<li><p>Or can we ‚Äútame‚Äù it in some way, and put it to use in Art, Design,
and Tech?</p></li>
<li><p>Have we been doing this all along? Have we been <u><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence"><em>holding
infinity in the palm of our
hands</em></a></u>,
in the ‡§π‡§æ‡§• ‡§ï‡•Ä‡•á ‡§≤‡§ï‡•Ä‡§∞‡•á?</p></li>
<li><p>What <strong>diagrams or thought experiments</strong> can we create to do this?</p></li>
<li><p>WHY would this be a good idea? Is there a very <strong>Human Motivation</strong>
behind this desire we might have?</p></li>
