## Introduction
We read The Three Musketeers, and also saw a brief video from Squid Game. Let us further contemplate the actions of the characters. 

### Discussion-2

Are there COSTs to ACTIONs? Who decides?

-   Players
-   Payoffs
-   Game Matrix
-   Strategies

How does one minimize costs and maximize rewards?

What strategies are possible as a bowler in Cricket? As a batsman? What strategies are **permitted**? By whom?

## The Game of Trust

And finally, let us **play** a Game,  on the <u>[**Game of Trust Website**](https://ncase.me/trust)</u> !

## Robert Axelrod's Study on Cooperation

This is a famous study of the Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma by Robert Axelrod, **The Evolution of Cooperation**. [(PDF)](Axelrod-Hamilton.pdf). We will read just a we bit of it in class. 

And here is Robert Axelrod on the **RadioLab Podcast**

## What are the Assumptions in Game Theory?

-   That gains and pains can be **quantified**
-   Rationality
-   Players have identical and opposed aims (Symmetry)
-   In most cases, the game is **zero-sum**
-   Some form of spoke/unspoken agreement as to what may and may not be done ( i.e Rules of the Game )
