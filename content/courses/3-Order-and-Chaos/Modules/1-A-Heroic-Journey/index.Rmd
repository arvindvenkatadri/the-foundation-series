## Introduction: The Company of Strangers!

How many strangers do you "meet" everyday? Why is the Human Species
different from all others? Those two questions are not unrelated !!

The Human Species is perhaps unique in that we are able to <u>[cooperate
with strangers](https://fee.org/media/4316/547_42.pdf)</u>!! Yes! Do you
think that building and conducting a business is something like that?
No? Well, let us see a few quick stories!!

## Story-1

### Do you know who these four people are ?

### Movie Time!

Let us watch a (very very) small part of this movie, [The Three Musketeers -1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_(1973_live-action_film))

`r blogdown::shortcode("youtube","nOFhfw-u5fg")`


And here is an older, slightly longer version:


<iframe width="560" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WRR0k2-8i-I" title="The Three Musketeers(1935) - D&#39;Artagnan vs. Athos vs. Cardinal Guards" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>

If this does not work... the same clip is available here:

### Fiction Time!

Let us read aloud(!) a bit of good old classic fiction !! This is the Conversation that occurs right before the duel scene we saw in the video above.

<u>[**Chapter 5. THE KING'S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL'S GUARDS**](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1257/1257-h/1257-h.htm).</u>[^1]
Keep an eye on the conversation! And an ear open for French-ified English, I beseech you!!

Here is the audio reading of this chapter from <u>[Librivox.org](https://librivox.org/the-three-musketeers-by-alexandre-dumas/)</u>
