Let us read the famous nunnery scene from <u>[**Hamlet: To be or Not to
be**...](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be/)</u>

+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Shakespeare                    | Plain English (hopefully)     |
+================================+===============================+
| To be, or not to be: that is   | The first six words of the    |
| the question:                  | soliloquy establish a         |
|                                | balance. There is a direct    |
|                                | opposition – to be, or not to |
|                                | be. Hamlet is thinking about  |
|                                | life and death and pondering  |
|                                | a state of being versus a     |
|                                | state of not being – being    |
|                                | alive and being dead.         |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Whether ’tis nobler in the     | The balance continues with a  |
| mind to suffer\                | consideration of the way one  |
| *The slings and arrows of      | deals with life and death.    |
| outrageous fortune*,\          | Life is a lack of power: the  |
| Or to take arms against a *sea | living are at the mercy of    |
| of troubles*,\                 | *the blows of outrageous      |
| And by opposing end them?      | fortune*. Should we *nobly    |
|                                | suffer* or should we *take    |
|                                | arms and fight* against these |
|                                | random things?                |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| To die: to sleep;\             | The only action one can take  |
| No more; and by a sleep to say | against the things he lists   |
| we end\                        | among those blows is to end   |
| The heart-ache and the         | one’s life.                   |
| *thousand natural shocks*\     |                               |
| That flesh is heir to, ’tis a  | That’s the only way of        |
| consummation\                  | opposing them. The ‘sleep of  |
| Devoutly to be wish’d.         | death’ is therefore           |
|                                | empowering: killing oneself   |
|                                | is a way of taking action,    |
|                                | taking up arms, opposing and  |
|                                | defeating the slings and      |
|                                | arrows of outrageous fortune. |
|                                | Living is a passive state;    |
|                                | dying is an active state.     |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| To die, to sleep;\             | Death is something desirable  |
| To sleep: perchance to dream:  | – devoutly to be wished, a    |
| ay, there’s the rub;\          | consummation – a perfect      |
| For in that sleep of death     | closure. It’s nothing more    |
| what dreams may come\          | than a sleep.                 |
| When we have shuffled off this |                               |
| mortal coil,\                  | But there’s a catch, which    |
| Must give us pause: there’s    | Hamlet calls a rub. A ‘rub’   |
| the respect\                   | is a bowls term meaning an    |
| That makes calamity of so long | obstacle on the bowls lawn    |
| life;\                         | that diverts the bowl, so the |
| For who would bear the *whips  | fear of the life hereafter is |
| and scorns of time*,\          | the obstacle that makes us    |
| The oppressor’s wrong, the     | pause and perhaps change the  |
| proud man’s contumely,\        | direction of our thinking.    |
| The pangs of despised love,    |                               |
| the law’s delay,\              | We don’t control our dreams   |
| The insolence of office and    | so what dreams may come in    |
| the spurns\                    | that sleep in which we have   |
| That patient merit of the      | shuffled off all the fuss and |
| unworthy takes,\               | bother of life? He uses the   |
| When he himself might his      | term ‘[mortal coi             |
| quietus make\                  | l](h                          |
| With a bare bodkin? who would  | %20t%20t%20ps:%20//n%20os%20w |
| fardels bear,\                 | eat%20s%20hakes%20peare%20.co |

|                                | which is an Elizabethan word  |
|                                | for a big fuss. With that     |
|                                | thought, Hamlet stops to      |
|                                | reconsider. What will happen  |
|                                | when we have discarded all    |
|                                | the hustle and bustle of      |
|                                | life?                         |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| But that the *dread of         | *The problem with the         |
| something* after death,\       | proposition* is that the      |
| The *undiscover’d country*     | sleep of death is unknown and |
| from whose bourn\              | could be worse than life.     |
| No traveller returns, *puzzles |                               |
| the will*\                     | Hamlet now lets his           |
| And makes us rather bear those | imagination wander on the     |
| *ills we have*\                | subject of the voyages of     |
| Than fly to others that we     | discovery and the exploratory |
| know not of?                   | expeditions. Dying is like    |
|                                | crossing the border between   |
|                                | known and unknown geography.  |
|                                | One is likely to be lost in   |
|                                | that unmapped place, from     |
|                                | which one would never return. |
|                                | The implication is that there |
|                                | may be unimagined horrors in  |
|                                | that land.                    |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Thus conscience does make      | But there is more to it than  |
| cowards of us all;\            | that. It is not just about    |
| And thus the native hue of     | killing himself but also      |
| resolution\                    | about the mission he is on –  |

| With this regard their         | excuses for not killing him   |
| currents turn awry,\           | and turns away when he has    |
| And lose *the name of action*. | the chance. ‘Conscience does  |

|                                | core of the play.             |

: Hamlet’s ‘To Be Or Not To Be’ Speech, Act 3 Scene 1

Do you see a lot of "randomness" in that famous soliloquy? What do you
reckon was Hamlet's problem? In this soliloquy, Hamlet gives a list of
all the *random* things that annoy him about life: *the whips and scorns
of time*, *the oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, the pangs
of despised love, the law’s delay, the insolence of office and the
spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes*. There’s a sense of
agonized frustration in this soliloquy that however bad life is we’re
prevented from doing anything about it by fear of the unknown.

And yet, being Prince of Denmark, and having a lot of Questions, and
unmistakable Authority, he has to Act! How did he solve that problem? We
don't know for sure if Hamlet believed in Goddess Saraswati,
<u>[Shakespeare doesn't say, but Christopher Isherwood seems to think
so, on Page
3](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/35825580/vedanta-for-the-western-world-swami-vivekananda)</u>.

Aside: in Hindu mythology, who are the two who went into Hamlet's *"the
undiscover’d country"* and *did return*?
<u>[She](https://www.heartfulnessmagazine.com/a-story-of-everlasting-love)</u>
and <u>[he](<https://www.templepurohit.com/story-nachiketa-yama/>)</u>. But how
did they manage it?

Yes, they asked
<u>[Questions](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/pablo_picasso_102018!)</u> !

## Suppose we were Hamlet....

What would we want to know? What Questions would we have?

-   Who is our friend?
-   What is the chance that we will survive?
-   Who killed Dad?

Did Hamlet have an idea, any suspicion, that he might have wanted to
prove? Yes, he did, and that is why he *feigned madness*, so people
would open up and tell him things, in an unguarded way. So there was
<u>[**craft in his
madness**](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/hamlet/antichamlet.html)!!</u>

So here Hamlet tells his friends, Horatio and Marcellus, what he is
going to do, and swears them into silence:

> Here as before. [For the third time, Hamlet places his sword for the
> others to swear upon]\
> Never, so help you mercy,\
> How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself\
> (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet\
> To put an antic disposition on)\
> That you at such time seeing me never shall,\
> With arms encumbered thus, or thus head shaked,\
> Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase\
> As, "Well, we know," or "We could an if we would,"\
> And especially don't say <u>[**Hakuna Matata,
> Dude!!**](https://youtu.be/kaOIxll4LCA)</u>

### A Hypothesis worthy of Hamlet

So we know what *Hamlet* wanted to know, and how he planned to find out.

What about us?

If we wanted to know the truth of something, some guess, a hunch, or a
**Hypothesis** that we had, then we would need to conduct an
"Experiment", rather like Hamlet did, without quite going or *feigning
madness* of course. But there is a *Madness to/in the Method*, as we
will see...

!["Design of Experiments - A Workflow: A Madness in the
Method"](https://www.statsref.com/HTML/ppdac.png)

From
<u>[**StatsRef**](https://www.statsref.com/HTML/?statistics__statistical_analys.html)</u>
:

> The PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem
> definition/Hypothesis through to conclusions --- this is typically not
> the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a
> series of feedback loops. A summary of a revised PPDAC approach is
> shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise
> sequence (1→5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often
> will feed back to the previous stage.

> In addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the
> reverse direction, starting with Problem definition and then examining
> expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions
> (without pre-judging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues,
> step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e→a) determining the
> implications of these expectations for each stage of the process.

## Design of Experiments

Let us pretend we are Hamlet and design a simple experiment to find out
some "truth" (highly probable idea) that is important to us.

### [**No Free Hunch**](https://nofreehunch.org): Hypothesis Design

We learnt a lot (new) words from Hamlet, didn't we? How many do we
remember? What Hypothesis could be make? What do we have a hunch about?

Let us consider the <u>[**Short Term
Memory(STM)**](Lawrence-ADesignofExperimentsWorkshopasanIntroductiontoStatistics.pdf)</u>
of Foundation Students at SMI as our vehicle for testing similar
Hypotheses.[^1]

[^1]: Or we could use <u>[Guilford Alternative Uses Creative
    Test](https://curtbonk.com/bobweb/r546/modules/creativity/creativity_tests/guilford_uses_task.html)</u>

-   STM scores are significantly different between students of Design
    and those of Art (;-O)
-   STM is much better for those who use Windows as compared to those
    who use Macs
-   Any other factors, not related to types of individuals, but more
    like *parameters of STM itself*, also affect the STM scores, for
    example:
    -   Word complexity (Syllables per Word)
    -   No of Words
    -   Exposure Time and Recall Time

With the Guilford Divergent Thinking Test, you might consider:

-   Students who speak their Mother Tongue fluently score better in
    Divergent Thinking Scores (Fluency, Flexibility, Elaboration,
    Originality)
-   There is a significant difference in Guilford Scores between
    students from "small towns" and those from metros.

### Factors in Hypothesis

In each of these Hypotheses, we can see that there are *binary* (Yes/No)
(two-valued) parameters that are part of the test: `Art vs Design`,
`Windows vs Mac`, `Speaks Mother Tongue or Not`, `Small Town vs Metro`,
`Long vs Short List of Words`, `Short vs Long Words` and
`Long vs Short Exposure`.

If we want our experiment to be **fair** we must have:

-   Devise a test tool for each combination of binary parameters (*Test
    Type*)
-   the **same number** of subjects for each Test Type
-   **randomly** select the people as *respondents* each Test Type

We will choose one of these questions, or a similar one, and use the
**PPDAC Method** to proceed with our Experiment. This paper by Lawrence
to guide our Hypothesis Testing and the Design of our Experiment:

<u>[**Lawrence - A Design of Experiments Workshop as an Introduction to
Statistics -
PDF**](Lawrence-ADesignofExperimentsWorkshopasanIntroductiontoStatistics.pdf)</u>).

This is the paper describing a simple *Design of Experiments* workshop
in class much like ours. We will try to mimic as much of this as we can.
Do read through this in the evening today in preparation for our
experiment.

### Data Analysis-1: Comparison of STM Histograms using Excel and WTFcsv

Once our test/survey is complete, let us collate all the data for all
tests using this Excel <u>[**spreadsheet**](STM.xlsx)</u>, which we can
place on Google Drive for the whole class. (This is for the STM
Hypothesis; we can adapt this spreadsheet for any other hypothesis test
with categorical factors andscores.)

1.  Enter the data from all tests on the first sheet titled "RawData"
    (the one with the warning)
2.  Download and save as your own *named* local copy.
3.  **Duplicate this data** on the sheet titled "Data Duplicated". **Do
    not touch** the "RawData" sheet again. Good Practice to not touch
    original data!!
4.  For each of the *factors* under consideration, we will need to stack
    up STM scores from $2^3 = 8$ tests, i.e. eight columns.
5.  If we have three two-valued, categorical factors, we will get three
    sets of stacked scores, each from a (shuffled) set of the tests.
6.  Half the scores in these stacked columns will pertain to one *level*
    of the factor, and the other half of the scores will pertain to the
    other level. (This should remind you of the Karnaugh Map you may
    have learnt in your digital logic courses in school.). See example
    below: it shows how we can stack up the scores from *4* tests for
    each *level* of the parameter *p1*.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot2::theme_set(new = theme_classic())

dat <- tibble(scores = rep(20, 8),
              test = LETTERS[1:8])
params <- expand_grid(p1 = c("True", "False"), p2 = c("Long", "Short"), p3 = c("Big", "Small"))

scores <- cbind(dat, params)
scores %>% kableExtra::kable(align = "c")

p1 <- ggplot(scores, aes(x = test, y = scores, fill = test)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", colour = "black") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "seq",palette = "Set3") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "8 sets of 20 scores")

p2 <- ggplot(scores, aes(x = p1, y = scores, fill = test), colour = "black") + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack", colour = "black") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "seq",palette = "Set3") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Two sets of scores from 8 tests")

wrap_plots(p1,p2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1, guides = "collect")

```

1.  We will set up each of these *two stacked-score columns* in Col A on
    separate sheets, similar to the one shown in the sheet titled
    "Permutation Test". One sheet for each two-valued parameter.
2.  Create *paired* Histograms for each of the two stacked-score columns
    using WTFcsv, or Excel itself if you are confident. Ensure that
    there are *TWO* Histograms: one for each value of the factor under
    consideration.
3.  Inspection of the shapes and locations of these paired Histograms
    may give you an idea whether the factor under consideration has any
    effect on STM scores or none.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot2::theme_set(new = theme_classic())

p1_T<- tibble(values = rpois(n = 80, lambda = 10),
              p1 = rep("HIGH", 80))
p1_F<- tibble(values = rpois(n = 80, lambda = 5),
              p1 = rep("LOW", 80))
p1 <- rbind(p1_T, p1_F)

ggplot(p1, aes(x = values, fill = p1, colour = p1)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.3,) + theme_minimal() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(p1$values[p1$p1 == "HIGH"]), colour = "red", linewidth = 2, linetype = "dotdash") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(p1$values[p1$p1 == "LOW"]), colour = "#00BFC4", linewidth = 2, linetype = "dotdash") +
  labs(title = "Paired STM score Histograms for Factor ***p1***",
      y = "Count of STM scores",
      x = "STM Scores"
  ) +
  geom_textbox(x = 2.5, y = 15, label = "Mean Score <br> for p1(LOW)", alpha = 0.1, width = unit(0.2, "npc"), fill = "cornsilk", colour = "#00BFC4") + 
  geom_textbox(x = 12.5, y = 12, label = "Mean Score <br>for p1(HIGH)", alpha = 0.1, width = unit(0.2, "npc"), fill = "cornsilk", colour = "red") + 
  theme(plot.title = ggtext::element_markdown())

```

4.  Save these 6 histograms as PNG files on your machines and use them
    along with *Comic Generator* (discussed below) to tell the story of
    your Hypothesis Testing.

### Computing Parallel Worlds: The Permutation Test

What is we cannot trust our eyes to compare the pair-wise Histograms?

If there was considerable overlap?

Is there a better way? Yes by playing another Childhood Game, with **a
deck of cards** !!!

#### Before we play with cards, some background

> Student B. R. was annoyed by TV commercials. He suspected that there

```{r echo = FALSE}
scores <- tibble(
  basic = c(6.95,10.013,10.62,10.15,8.583,7.62,8.233,10.35,11.016,8.516),
  extended = c(3.383,7.8,9.416,4.66,5.36,7.63,4.95,8.013,7.8,9.58))

diff

> We'll pool all twenty observations, **randomly** pick 10 of them to

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
scores_long <- scores %>% pivot_longer(., cols = c("basic", "extended"), values_to = "times", names_to = "channel")
scores_long %>% knitr::kable()

null_dist_time <-
  do(10000) * diff(mean(
    scores_long$times ~ shuffle(scores_long$channel),
    data = scores_long))

null_dist_time %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = extended)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = extended >= 2.34)) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 2.34), colour = "green") + 
  labs(x = "Distribution of Diff in Ad Time Means under null hypothesis for Channel Type", title = "Figure1 - Is 2.34 possible by Chance?") + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend("Greater than 2.34"))

### Data Analysis-2: Creating Parallel Worlds

1.  We will execute on Permutation Test on one sheet step by step and
    decide whether that factor had a significant *effect* on STM scores.
2.  We **pretend** that there is no difference in scores whether the
    factor is chosen on way or another.
3.  We **mechanize this pretence** by lumping "both kinds" of scores
    together and shuffle them and divide them, **randomly** into two
    groups, and take the difference in scores.
4.  We can do this, like we did with our Monte Carlo experiment, many
    many times and calculate difference in scores each time. (It is like
    inventing many parallel worlds)
5.  If we look at the way these **randomly computed** scores are
    distributed and **compare** with the one measurement we did see, we
    can decide whether Mother Nature is up to something, or we are able
    to mimic the Mom.
6.  If we are **not** able to mimic Mom, then **Mom always knows** and
    we bow to her and ascribe a significance to the factor under
    consideration. Else, nope.
7.  Replicate this test for the other (binary) factors.

Apropos: how could we do this for non-binary factors ...??!!!
