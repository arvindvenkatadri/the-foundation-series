<p>Let us read the famous nunnery scene from <u><a href="https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be/"><strong>Hamlet: To be or Not to

<td>To be, or not to be: that is
the question:</td>
<td>The first six words of the
soliloquy establish a
balance. There is a direct
opposition – to be, or not to
be. Hamlet is thinking about
life and death and pondering
a state of being versus a
state of not being – being
alive and being dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Whether ’tis nobler in the
mind to suffer<br />
<em>The slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune</em>,<br />
Or to take arms against a <em>sea
of troubles</em>,<br />
And by opposing end them?</td>
<td>The balance continues with a
consideration of the way one
deals with life and death.
Life is a lack of power: the
living are at the mercy of
<em>the blows of outrageous
fortune</em>. Should we <em>nobly
suffer</em> or should we <em>take
arms and fight</em> against these
random things?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>To die: to sleep;<br />
No more; and by a sleep to say
we end<br />
The heart-ache and the
<em>thousand natural shocks</em><br />
That flesh is heir to, ’tis a
consummation<br />
Devoutly to be wish’d.</td>
<td><p>The only action one can take
against the things he lists
among those blows is to end
one’s life.</p>
<p>That’s the only way of
opposing them. The ‘sleep of
death’ is therefore
empowering: killing oneself
is a way of taking action,
taking up arms, opposing and
defeating the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune.
Living is a passive state;
dying is an active state.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>To die, to sleep;<br />
To sleep: perchance to dream:
ay, there’s the rub;<br />
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come<br />
When we have shuffled off this
mortal coil,<br />
Must give us pause: there’s
the respect<br />
That makes calamity of so long
life;<br />
For who would bear the <em>whips
and scorns of time</em>,<br />
The oppressor’s wrong, the
proud man’s contumely,<br />
The pangs of despised love,
the law’s delay,<br />
The insolence of office and
the spurns<br />
That patient merit of the
unworthy takes,<br />
When he himself might his
quietus make<br />
With a bare bodkin? who would
fardels bear,<br />
To <em>grunt and sweat under a
weary life</em>,</td>
<td><p>Death is something desirable
– devoutly to be wished, a
consummation – a perfect
closure. It’s nothing more
than a sleep.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch, which
Hamlet calls a rub. A ‘rub’
is a bowls term meaning an
obstacle on the bowls lawn
that diverts the bowl, so the
fear of the life hereafter is
the obstacle that makes us
pause and perhaps change the
direction of our thinking.</p>
<p>We don’t control our dreams
so what dreams may come in
that sleep in which we have
shuffled off all the fuss and
bother of life? He uses the
term ‘<a href="h%20%20t%20t%20ps:%20//n%20os%20w%20eat%20s%20hakes%20peare%20.co%20%2%200%20m%20/%20q%20u%20o%20%20t%20es/famous/mortal-coil/">mortal coi
l</a>,’
which is an Elizabethan word
for a big fuss. With that
thought, Hamlet stops to
reconsider. What will happen
when we have discarded all
the hustle and bustle of
life?</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>But that the <em>dread of
something</em> after death,<br />
The <em>undiscover’d country</em>
from whose bourn<br />
No traveller returns, <em>puzzles
the will</em><br />
And makes us rather bear those
<em>ills we have</em><br />
Than fly to others that we
know not of?</td>
<td><p><em>The problem with the
proposition</em> is that the
sleep of death is unknown and
could be worse than life.</p>
<p>Hamlet now lets his
imagination wander on the
subject of the voyages of
discovery and the exploratory
expeditions. Dying is like
crossing the border between
known and unknown geography.
One is likely to be lost in
that unmapped place, from
which one would never return.
The implication is that there
may be unimagined horrors in
that land.</p></td>

With this regard their
currents turn awry,<br />
And lose <em>the name of action</em>.</p>
<p><br />
</p></td>
<td><p>But there is more to it than
that. It is not just about
killing himself but also
about the mission he is on –
to avenge his father’s death
by killing his father’s
murderer. Throughout the
action of the play, he makes
excuses for not killing him
and turns away when he has
the chance. ‘Conscience does
make cowards of us all.’
Convention demands that he
kill Claudius but murder is a
sin and that conflict is the
core of the play.</p>
<p>At the end of the soliloquy,
he pulls himself out of this
reflective mode by deciding
that too much thinking about
it is the thing that will
prevent the action he has to
rise to.</p></td>

<p>Do you see a lot of “randomness” in that famous soliloquy? What do you
reckon was Hamlet’s problem? In this soliloquy, Hamlet gives a list of
all the <em>random</em> things that annoy him about life: <em>the whips and scorns
of time</em>, <em>the oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, the pangs
of despised love, the law’s delay, the insolence of office and the
spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes</em>. There’s a sense of
agonized frustration in this soliloquy that however bad life is we’re
prevented from doing anything about it by fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>And yet, being Prince of Denmark, and having a lot of Questions, and
unmistakable Authority, he has to Act! How did he solve that problem? We
don’t know for sure if Hamlet believed in Goddess Saraswati,
<u><a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/35825580/vedanta-for-the-western-world-swami-vivekananda">Shakespeare doesn’t say, but Christopher Isherwood seems to think
so, on Page
3</a></u>.</p>
<p>Aside: in Hindu mythology, who are the two who went into Hamlet’s <em>“the
undiscover’d country”</em> and <em>did return</em>?
<u><a href="https://www.heartfulnessmagazine.com/a-story-of-everlasting-love">She</a></u>
and <u><a href="https://www.templepurohit.com/story-nachiketa-yama/">he</a></u>. But how
did they manage it?</p>
<p>Yes, they asked
<u><a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/pablo_picasso_102018">Questions</a></u>!</p>
</div>
<div id="suppose-we-were-hamlet." class="section level2">
<h2>Suppose we were Hamlet….</h2>
<p>What would we want to know? What Questions would we have?</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is our friend?</li>
<li>What is the chance that we will survive?</li>
<li>Who killed Dad?</li>
</ul>
<p>Did Hamlet have an idea, any suspicion, that he might have wanted to
prove? Yes, he did, and that is why he <em>feigned madness</em>, so people
would open up and tell him things, in an unguarded way. So there was
<u><a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/hamlet/antichamlet.html"><strong>craft in his
madness</strong></a>!!</u></p>
<p>So here Hamlet tells his friends, Horatio and Marcellus, what he is
going to do, and swears them into silence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here as before. [For the third time, Hamlet places his sword for the
others to swear upon]<br />
Never, so help you mercy,<br />
How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself<br />
(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br />
To put an antic disposition on)<br />
That you at such time seeing me never shall,<br />
With arms encumbered thus, or thus head shaked,<br />
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase<br />
As, “Well, we know,” or “We could an if we would,”<br />

Dude!!</strong></a></u></p>
</blockquote>
<div id="a-hypothesis-worthy-of-hamlet" class="section level3">
<h3>A Hypothesis worthy of Hamlet</h3>
<p>So we know what <em>Hamlet</em> wanted to know, and how he planned to find out.</p>
<p>What about us?</p>
<p>If we wanted to know the truth of something, some guess, a hunch, or a
<strong>Hypothesis</strong> that we had, then we would need to conduct an
“Experiment”, rather like Hamlet did, without quite going or <em>feigning
madness</em> of course. But there is a <em>Madness to/in the Method</em>, as we
will see…</p>

:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem
definition/Hypothesis through to conclusions — this is typically not
the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a
series of feedback loops. A summary of a revised PPDAC approach is
shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise
sequence (1→5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often
will feed back to the previous stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the
reverse direction, starting with Problem definition and then examining
expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions
(without pre-judging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues,
step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e→a) determining the
implications of these expectations for each stage of the process.</p>

<h2>Design of Experiments</h2>
<p>Let us pretend we are Hamlet and design a simple experiment to find out
some “truth” (highly probable idea) that is important to us.</p>
<div id="no-free-hunch-hypothesis-design" class="section level3">
<h3><u><a href="https://nofreehunch.org"><strong>No Free Hunch</strong></a></u>: Hypothesis Design</h3>
<p>We learnt a lot (new) words from Hamlet, didn’t we? How many do we
remember? What Hypothesis could be make? What do we have a hunch about?</p>
<p>Let us consider the <u><a href="Lawrence-ADesignofExperimentsWorkshopasanIntroductiontoStatistics.pdf"><strong>Short Term
Memory(STM)</strong></a></u>
of Foundation Students at SMI as our vehicle for testing similar
Hypotheses.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>STM scores are significantly different between students of Design
and those of Art (;-O)</li>
<li>STM is much better for those who use Windows as compared to those
who use Macs</li>
<li>Any other factors, not related to types of individuals, but more
like <em>parameters of STM itself</em>, also affect the STM scores, for
example:
<ul>
<li>Word complexity (Syllables per Word)</li>
<li>No of Words</li>
<li>Exposure Time and Recall Time</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>With the Guilford Divergent Thinking Test, you might consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students who speak their Mother Tongue fluently score better in
Divergent Thinking Scores (Fluency, Flexibility, Elaboration,
Originality)</li>
<li>There is a significant difference in Guilford Scores between
students from “small towns” and those from metros.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="factors-in-hypothesis" class="section level3">
<h3>Factors in Hypothesis</h3>
<p>In each of these Hypotheses, we can see that there are <em>binary</em> (Yes/No)
(two-valued) parameters that are part of the test: <code>Art vs Design</code>,
<code>Windows vs Mac</code>, <code>Speaks Mother Tongue or Not</code>, <code>Small Town vs Metro</code>,
<code>Long vs Short List of Words</code>, <code>Short vs Long Words</code> and
<code>Long vs Short Exposure</code>.</p>
<p>If we want our experiment to be <strong>fair</strong> we must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Devise a test tool for each combination of binary parameters (<em>Test
Type</em>)</li>
<li>the <strong>same number</strong> of subjects for each Test Type</li>
<li><strong>randomly</strong> select the people as <em>respondents</em> each Test Type</li>
</ul>
<p>We will choose one of these questions, or a similar one, and use the
<strong>PPDAC Method</strong> to proceed with our Experiment. This paper by Lawrence
to guide our Hypothesis Testing and the Design of our Experiment:</p>
<p><u><a href="Lawrence-ADesignofExperimentsWorkshopasanIntroductiontoStatistics.pdf"><strong>Lawrence - A Design of Experiments Workshop as an Introduction to
Statistics -
PDF</strong></a></u>).</p>
<p>This is the paper describing a simple <em>Design of Experiments</em> workshop
in class much like ours. We will try to mimic as much of this as we can.
Do read through this in the evening today in preparation for our
experiment.</p>

<h3>Data Analysis-1: Comparison of STM Histograms using Excel and WTFcsv</h3>
<p>Once our test/survey is complete, let us collate all the data for all
tests using this Excel <u><a href="STM.xlsx"><strong>spreadsheet</strong></a></u>, which we can
place on Google Drive for the whole class. (This is for the STM
Hypothesis; we can adapt this spreadsheet for any other hypothesis test
with categorical factors andscores.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Enter the data from all tests on the first sheet titled “RawData”
(the one with the warning)</li>
<li>Download and save as your own <em>named</em> local copy.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate this data</strong> on the sheet titled “Data Duplicated”. <strong>Do
not touch</strong> the “RawData” sheet again. Good Practice to not touch
original data!!</li>
<li>For each of the <em>factors</em> under consideration, we will need to stack
up STM scores from <span class="math inline">\(2^3 = 8\)</span> tests, i.e. eight columns.</li>
<li>If we have three two-valued, categorical factors, we will get three
sets of stacked scores, each from a (shuffled) set of the tests.</li>
<li>Half the scores in these stacked columns will pertain to one <em>level</em>
of the factor, and the other half of the scores will pertain to the
other level. (This should remind you of the Karnaugh Map you may
have learnt in your digital logic courses in school.). See example
below: it shows how we can stack up the scores from <em>4</em> tests for
each <em>level</em> of the parameter <em>p1</em>.</li>

If there was considerable overlap? Is there a better way? Can we fix this by playing another Childhood Game? Yes, with <strong>a deck of cards</strong>! But before we play with cards, some background:</p>

<p>Student B. R. was annoyed by TV commercials. He suspected that there
were more commercials in the “basic” TV channels, the ones that come
with a cable TV subscription, than in the “extended” channels you pay
extra for. To check this, he collected the data shown in Table 1. He
measured an average of 9.21 minutes of commercials per half hour in
the basic channels, vs only 6.87 minutes in the extended channels.
This seems to support his hypothesis. But there is not much
data—perhaps the difference was just random. The poor guy could only
stand to watch 20 random half hours of TV. Actually, he didn’t even do
that—he got his girlfriend to watch half of it. (Are you as appalled
by the deluge of commercials as I am? This is per half-hour!)</p>

<p>How easy would it be for a difference of 2.34 minutes to occur just by
chance? To answer this, we suppose there really is no difference
between the two groups, that “basic” and “extended” are just labels.
So what would happen if we assign labels randomly? How often would a
difference like 2.34 occur?</p>
<p>We’ll pool all twenty observations, <strong>randomly</strong> pick 10 of them to
label “basic” and label the rest “extended”, and compute the

<p>The observed statistic 2.34 is also shown; the fraction of the
distribution to the right of that value (≥ 2.34) is the probability
that random labeling would give a difference that large. In this case,
the probability of this value ( area coloured in green ) is &lt; 0.005.</p>
<p>It would be rare for a difference this large to occur by chance. We
have randomly tried “all possible chances” and are <em>hardly able to
achieve similar,</em> and the rarer something is, the more likely that
there is an underlying truth.</p>
<p>And therefore we conclude there is a real difference between the
groups and that ad time is different between <code>basic</code> and <code>extended</code> TV

many times and calculate difference in scores each time. (It is like
inventing many parallel worlds)</li>
<li>If we look at the way these <strong>randomly computed</strong> scores are
distributed and <strong>compare</strong> with the one measurement we did see, we
can decide whether Mother Nature is up to something, or we are able
to mimic the Mom.</li>
<li>If we are <strong>not</strong> able to mimic Mom, then <strong>Mom always knows</strong> and
we bow to her and ascribe a significance to the factor under
consideration. Else, nope.</li>
<li>Replicate this test for the other (binary) factors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apropos: how could we do this for non-binary factors …??!!!</p>
