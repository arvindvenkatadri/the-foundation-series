## A Model for Proximity: The Voronoi and the Delaunay Diagrams

So how do we model "proximity"? 

<u>[**Predator-Prey Dynamics**](/pdf/Proximity/FollowingtheHerd.pdf)</u>


### Plotting the Voronoi Diagram

How do we plot this diagram?

We will use this tool: <u>[**Geogebra**](https://www.geogebra.org/classic)</u>

Download and install this on your laptops. You can also use it in your browser <https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en> and download the *.ggb* files that you create. 

1. Exercise 1: Let us first see <u>[**Soho with the Voronoi Diagram**](/pdf/Proximity/SohoMap.ggb)</u>

Now let us make such a diagram step by step:

1. Exercise 2: Let us try with just three points and see what we need to do to plot the Voronoi Diagram.

1. Exercise 3: With 4 points: <u>[Four Pointer Voronoi](/pdf/Proximity/four points.ggb)</u>

1. Exercise 4: Let us now add more points. How do we make a multi-point Voronoi? We need to make a <u>[**"list of points" in Geogebra**](/pdf/Proximity/VoronoiLargeNoOfPointsInGeogebra.pdf)</u>



## Fun Stuff with Geogebra and Voronoi

1. Predator Prey Movement....
 - Create a set of points in Geogebra. 
 - Colour/Shape one of the outermost points as a predator which circles the herd. 
 - Use the Voronoi diagram to model the *Zone of Danger* for each of the animals in the inner herd. 
 - Try **Animation** in Geogebra !!
 
2. Service Areas with Voronoi
- Import a 5km * 5km square of area in your home town, from Google Maps, into Geogebra. 
- Locate points of interest, all in one category ( ATMs, Post Offices, Hospitals, Police Stations...)
- Plot the Voronoi Diagram to show the area served by each such institution.
- Calculate the area in Geogebra.
- Assume a flat population/sqkm and use that to calculate the number of people served by each.

**All** of this can be done without leaving Geogebra !!

3. Voronoi Portraits and Facial Recognition

A. I am Predator
- Take a picture of yourself and import it into Geogebra
- Plot Points on the Portrait such that the main facial features are defined.
- Use a Delaunay Triagulation of these points to create a Portrait.

B. My Face is My Fortune
- Do the same for a famous person, past or present.
- Run a small survey in the class to see how many people can recognize celebrity!
