## Introduction: The Company of Strangers!

How many strangers do you "meet" everyday? Why is the Human Species
different from all others? Those two questions are not unrelated !!

The Human Species is perhaps unique in that we are able to <u>[cooperate
with strangers](https://fee.org/media/4316/547_42.pdf)</u>!! Yes! Do you
think that designing things, building and conducting a business, or
making art is something like that? No? Well, let us see a few quick
stories!!

## Story-1

### Do you know who these four people are ?

### Movie Time!

Let us watch a (very very) small part of this movie, <u>[The Three
~~Pangas~~ Musketeers-1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_(1973_live-action_film))</u>

`r blogdown::shortcode("youtube","QPun-5dtld0")`
<br>
`r blogdown::shortcode("youtube","nOFhfw-u5fg")`

And here is an older, slightly longer version:

<iframe width="560" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WRR0k2-8i-I" title="The Three Musketeers(1935) - D&#39;Artagnan vs. Athos vs. Cardinal Guards" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>

<br> If this does not work... the same clip is available here:
<https://www.tcm.com/video/454255/three-musketeers-the-1973-movie-clip-we-are-only-three/>

### Fiction Time!

Let us read aloud(!) a bit of good old classic fiction !! This is the
Conversation that occurs right before the duel scene we saw in the video
above.

<u>[**Chapter 5. THE KING'S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL'S
GUARDS**](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1257/1257-h/1257-h.htm).</u>[^1]
Keep an eye on the conversation! And an ear open for French-ified
English, I beseech you!!

[^1]: Download *The Three Musketeers* e-book at
    <u>[ProjectGutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257)</u>

Here is the audio reading of this chapter from
<u>[Librivox.org](https://librivox.org/the-three-musketeers-by-alexandre-dumas/)</u>

### Discussion-1
- <u>["When have to fight, fight! Don't talk!"](https://youtu.be/JrYtD7gSWsI?feature=shared)</u>
- Why were they so polite to each other? (Oh, These French...)
- Were they talking as if they didn't want to fight?
- But to "have fought already"?
- The **Shadow of the Future**

## Story-2

What about this game ?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://criticalcommons.org/embed?m=vufgXphCO" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>

</iframe>

## Discussion-2

What **emotions** or **motivations** are portrayed by the characters in
the story? We can think of the "4Rs":

-   Reward
-   Regret aka FOMO
-   Risk
-   Retribution/Punishment

### Nice Guys Finish First

## <u>[Wait, But Why?](https://waitbutwhy.com)</u>

- Many public behaviours require us to *trust* strangers
- We have Rule of Law based on this trust
- If there is no **C** at first, then everybody does a **D**
- That is the source of the **Dilemma**
- As Artists and Designers, and Creators, we need to practice our craft that in such a way as to induce *niceness*...
- So what will you make? A movie? An ad? A public sign-board? A street play? An illustration? A "spatial arrangement"? A policy or a law?
