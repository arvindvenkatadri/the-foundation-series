## Program overview

>It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience. — ALBERT EINSTEIN

>To become wise you’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models.— CHARLIE MUNGER

>All Models Are Wrong But Some Are Useful. — GEORGE BOX

In this Unit, we will take inspiration from Story, Drama, and Paintings to contemplate certain aspects of Human Experience. We will try and make sense of these aspects of experience using **Models** that we will create. These Models may resemble a Thought Experiment, or a Diagram, or a simple Procedure, or a piece of Computer Code. The Models should provide data and directions for artistic and design endeavours. In effect, we will go from **Stories to Data**, rather than the other way around. 

The Models will be understood, internalized, fitted in with what we already know, and generalized to new applications. This will done with the help of activities based on games, videos, art-related activities, open source software tools, field experiments, field visits, additional readings, writings and discussions. 

At the end of the Unit, the students will use the gamut of Models / Tools / Techniques encountered in class to design an artifact or performance, working individually or in teams.




## Some Teasers!!

1.This century was named by Stephen Hawking as the **Age of Complexity**. [(Weblink)](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/stephen-hawkings-advice-for-twenty-first-century-grads-embrace-complexity/). 
> A few years ago, Hawking was asked what he thought of the common opinion that the twentieth century was that of biology and the twenty-first century would be that of physics. Hawking replied that in his opinion the twenty-first century would be the "century of complexity". That remark probably holds more useful advice for contemporary students than they realize since it points to at least two skills which are going to be essential for new college grads in the age of complexity: statistics and data visualization.
