# What you will learn

- {{<hl>}}Basics of ML{{</hl>}} using examples from Literature, Painting and Music and Games and Kitchen Recipes
- Develop Intuition for when to use which ML algorithm:

  - Regression  
  - Classification  
  - Clustering  
  
- Develop Intuition for the underlying Math Structures:
  - Decision Trees leading up to Random Forests
  - Linear Equations, Slopes, Intercepts, and Errors
  - Support Vector Machines and Kernel Tricks
  
- Doing **point-and-click** ML using an open source ML tool called **Orange** [(**Weblink**)](https://orangedatamining.com/)
