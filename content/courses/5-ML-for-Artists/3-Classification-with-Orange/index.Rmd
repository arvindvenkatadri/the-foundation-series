## A Childhood Game

Have you played a Childhood Game called **20 Questions**? Someone has a "target" entity in mind ( a person or a thing or a literary character) and the others need to discover that entity by asking 20 questions. 

- How does one create questions in the game?  
  - Categories?
  - Numbers? How?
  - Comparisons?

- What sort of answers can you expect for each question?

## Twenty Questions Game as a Play with Data...

Assuming we think of a 20Q Target as say, celebrity singer like Taylor Swift, or a cartoon character like Thomas the Tank Engine, what would an underlying "data structure" look like? We would ask Questions for instance in the following order to find the target of Taylor Swift:  

  - Human?(Yes)  
  - Living?(Yes)  
  - Male?(No)  
  - Celebrity?(Yes)  
  - Music?(Yes)  
  - USA?(Yes)

Oh...Taylor Swift!!!


Let us try to construct the "datasets" underlying this game!

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
taylor <- tibble(name = "Taylor Swift", Occupation = "Singer", Sex = "F", Living = T, Nationality = "USA", genre = "country/rock", pet = "Scottish Fold Cats")
thomas <- tibble(name = "Thomas, the Tank Engine", Type = "Cartoon Character", Living = F, human = F, Nationality = "UK", colour = "blue", material = "metal")
taylor %>% knitr::kable()
thomas %>% knitr::kable()
```

It should be fairly clear that the Questions we ask are based on the COLUMNs in the respective **1-row datasets**! The TARGET Column in both cases is the **name** column.


## What is a Decision Tree?

Can you imagine how the **20 Questions** Game can be shown as a **tree**? 


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

grViz("
digraph tree_diagram {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = false, fontsize = 10]

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = circle,
        fontname = Helvetica,
        label = root]
  A; 

  node [shape = circle,
        fixedsize = true,
        label = nodes,
        fillcolor = purple,
        width = 0.9] // sets as circles
  B; C; 

node [shape = diamond,
        fixedsize = true,
        label = leaf,
        color = springgreen,
        width = 0.9] 
  D;E;

  # several 'edge' statements
  A->B[color = blue, label = yes]; A->C[color = red,label = no]; 
B->D[color = blue,label = yes]; B->E[color = red,label = no]
}
")
```

Each Question we ask, based on one of the Feature columns, begets a Yes/No answer and we turn the left or right accordingly. When we arrive at the leaf, we should be in a position to *guess* the answer !



## Twenty times 20 Questions !!

What if the dataset we had contained **many** rows, instead of just one row? How would we play the 20Q Game in this situation? Here is a sample of the famous *penguins* dataset:


```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% slice_sample(n = 12) %>% knitr::kable()
```

As before, we would need to look at the dataset as containing a **TARGET** column which we want to predict using several other **FEATURE** columns. Let us choose **species**.

When we look at the FEATURE columns, We would need to formulate questions based on *entire columns* at a time. For instance:

- *"Is the *bill_length_mm* greater than 45mm?"* considers the entire *bill_length_mm* FEATURE column
- Is the *sex* female?  considers the entire *sex* column
- If the specific **FEATURE** column is a **Numerical** (N) variable, the question would use some "thresholding" as shown in the question above, to convert the Numerical Variable into a Categorical variable.
- If a specific **FEATURE** column is a **Categorical** (C) variable, the question would be like a *filter* operation in Excel. 

Either way, we end up answering with a **smaller and smaller subset of rows in the dataset**, to which the questions are answered with a Yes. It is as if we played **many** 20 Questions games in parallel, ***since there are so many simultaneous "answers"***! 

Once we exhaust **all** the FEATURE columns, then what remains is a subset (i.e. rows)  of the original dataset and we read off the TARGET column, which should now contain a set of identical entries, e.g. "Adelie". Thus we can extend a *single-target* 20Q game to a **multiple-target** one using a larger dataset. (Note how the multiple targets are all the same: "Adelie", or "Gentoo", or "Chinstrap")

This forms the basic intuition for a Machine Learning Algorithm called a **Decision Tree**. Note that the tree is plotted **inverted**: trunk on top and the leaves below. <u>[Only God can make a tree.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/12744/trees)</u>

### Decision Tree in Orange

Let us visualize this Decision Tree in Orange. Look at the now famous `penguins` dataset, available here:

<u><https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv></u>

We see that there are three `species` of penguins, that live on three `islands`. The measurements for each penguin are `flipper_length_mm`, `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, and  `body_mass_g`. 

1. **Task 1:** Create a few data visualizations for the variables, and pairs of variables from this dataset. 

2. **Task 2:** Can you inspect the visualizations and imagine how each of this dataset can be used in a `20 Questions Game`, to create a **Decision Tree** for this dataset as shown below?

![Penguins Decision Tree!](penguins.png)


#### What did we learn? 

- The 20Q Game can be viewed as a "Decision Tree" of Questions and Answers, 
- Each **fork** in the game is a Question. 
- Depending upon whether the current answer is **yes or no**, we turn in one direction or the other.
- Each of our questions is **based** on the information available in one or other of the columns!!
- We arrive at a final "answer" or "target" after a particular sequence of yes/no answers. This is the one of the **leaf** nodes in the Tree. 
- The `island` and the `species` columns are **categories** and are especially suited to being the **targets** for a 20 Questions Game. 
- We can therefore use an **entire column** of data as our 20Questions **target**, rather than just one entity, person. 

This is how we will use this Game as a Model for our first ML algorithm, **classification** using Decision Trees.



## How do we Make Predictions using our Decision Tree

Our aim is to make `predictions`. Predictions of what? When we are given new unseen data in the same format, we should be able to predict TARGET variable using the same FEATURE columns. 

NOTE: This  that is usually a **class/category** (We **CAN** also predict a **numerical value** with a Decision Tree; but we will deal with that later.)

In order to make predictions with completely unseen data, we need to first check if the algorithm is working well with **known** data. The way to do this is to use a large portion of data to **design the tree**, and then use the tree to predict some aspect of the remaining, but similar, data. Let us split the `penguins` dataset into two pieces: a `training set` to design our tree, and a `test set` to check how it is working.

Download this <u>[**penguin tree file**](penguins-tree.ows)</u> and open it in Orange.

How good are the Predictions? What is the **Classification Error Rate**? 



## How Many Trees do we Need? Enter the Random Forest!

Check all your individual Decision Trees: 

- do they ask the same Questions? 
- Do they fork pretty much in the same way? 

Yes, they all seem to use the same set of parameters to reach the target. So they are capable of being "biased" and make the **same mistakes**. So we ask: Does it help to use more than one tree, if all the questions/forks in the Trees are similar?

No...we need different Trees to be able to **ask different questions**, based on different **variables** or **features** in the data. That will make the Trees as different as possible and so...unbiased. This is what we also saw when we played 20Q: offbeat questions opened up some avenues for predicting the answer/target. 

A forest of such trees is called <u>[~~**the Wild Wood**~~](https://youtu.be/zE0uAfAuZ08)</u> **a Random Forest** ! 



## An Introduction to Random Forests

In the Random Forest method, we do as follows:

1. Split the dataset into `training` and `test` subsets (70::30 proportion is very common). Keep aside the `testing` dataset for final testing.
2. Decide on a number of trees, say 100-500 in the forest. 
2. Take the training dataset and repeatedly sample some of the rows in it. Rows can be **repeated** too; this is called `bootstrap sampling`.
3. Give this sampled training set to each tree. Each tree develops a question from this dataset, in a **random fashion**, using a **randomly chosen** variable. 
E.g. with `penguins`, if our target is `species`, then some trees will will use `island`, some others will use `body_mass_g` and some others may use `bill_length_mm`.
4. Each tree will "grow its questions" in a unique way !!  Since the questions are possibly based on a different variable at each time, the trees will grow in very different ways. 
5. Stop when the required accuracy has been achieved (the sets contain observations/rows from only one `species` predominantly)
6. With the `test set` let each tree vote on which `species` it has decided upon. Take the majority vote. 

Phew!!

Let's get a visual sense of how all this works:

## Random Forest Classification for Heart Patients

Do you want to develop an ML model for heart patients? We have a dataset of heart patients at the [**University of California, ~~Arvind~~ Irvine ML Dataset Repository**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)

[**Heart Patient Data**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data). Import into Orange !!

What are the variables?

1. (age): age in years     
2. (sex): 1 = male; 0 = female   
3. (cp): chest-pain type( 4 types, 1/2/3/4)      
4. (trestbps): resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. (chol) : serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. (fbs): (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)  (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. (restecg): resting electrocardiograph results (0 = normal; 1= ST-T wave abnormality; 3 = LV hypertrophy)
8. (thalach): maximum heart rate achieved
9. (exang): exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) (remember **Puneet Rajkumar**)  
10. (oldpeak): ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
11. (slope): the slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
        - Value 1: upsloping  
        - Value 2: flat  
        - Value 3: downsloping   
12. (ca): number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy  
13. (thal): 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect    
14. (num) : **the target attribute**, diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)  
        - Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing  
        - Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing  
        (in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels)

We will create a Random Forest Model for this dataset, and compare with the Decision Tree for the same dataset. 


## Are Random Forests an Example of Complexity?

Does The Random Forest somehow embody the "4A"s of Complexity? (Agents, Actions, Again, Aggregate)? Can we try to interpret the algorithm as such? Here goes:

- Each little *tree* in the Random Forest is an independent **Agent**
- Each agent-tree has a vocabulary of **Actions**
     * to choose randomly a *subset* of variables from the big dataset
     * To independently vote using their choice of variables
- And the "votes" are **Aggregated** to decide the final prediction
- Which is greater (better, accurate with higher confidence) than each individual Agent-Trees
- <u>[Do it **Again**](https://youtu.be/jmdiKePVUy8)</u> when presented with fresh data

Not bad, is it, as a metaphor for Random Forests?

## How good is my Random Forest?
There are good few metrics to state the performance of our Random Forest. We should know these:

1. `Classification Error` : How many mismatches? Simple enough.
2. `Gini Impurity`: Each Group may end up mis-classifying observations from *any* of the other groups. The Gini Impurity index measures the variance across all groups. If there are $M$ groups identified from what are actually $K$ classes, then $p_{mk}$ defines the proportion of `k-class` observations that are actually in `Group-m`. The Gini Impurity is defined as:

$$
G = \sum_{k=1}^{K} ~ p_{mk} * (1 - p_{mk})
$$
(Very similar to the formula for variance of a binary variable).

A little examination of the formula will show that when any proportion $p_{mk}$ is either very high or very low, then the Gini index is small. A small $p_{mk}$ means that each leaf is highly "pure"; a large one means that we have labels completely the other way around or swapped!!

A small Gini index is a good thing!

3. `Cross Entropy`  
In line with Claude Shannon's idea of `information entropy`, we can define the Cross-entropy as:

$$
D = \sum_{k=1}^{K} p_{mk} * log(p_{mk})
$$
Again, this tells us how much a particular group has members from another class...so a small Cross-Entropy is a good thing.
